### 5.11 Hidden frames

When a frame is decoded it will normally be shown. However, there is also an
option to decode a frame but not show it. The frame can still be saved into the
reference frame slots for use in inter prediction of future frames.

This option can be used to make a **golden frame** that contains a high quality
version of various objects in the scene. This frame can be used to construct
other frames.

It is also possible to send a very short frame (just one or two bytes) that
tells the decoder to directly show one of the frame slots.
