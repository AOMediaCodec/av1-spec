### Reference Frames

If an object is moving across a scene it can happen that the best source of an
inter prediction for a block is not the previous frame (where the block was
obscured by the moving object), but the frame before that.

AV1 provides options for inter blocks to specify which frame is used as the
reference frame. A decoder maintains 8 slots, each slot with a decoded
reference frame. When a new frame is decoded, the frame header specifies which
of the slots should be overwritten with the new frame.

Although 8 slots are maintained, any particular frame can make use of at most 3
reference frames. Which reference frames to use are specified in the frame
header, and then the detailed choice between these 3 is specified in the mode
info at the coding block level. Each block (of size above or equal to 8x8) is
allowed to use up to 2 reference frames. All the sub8x8 blocks inside an 8x8
block share the same reference frame combination, which allows up to 2
reference frames.
