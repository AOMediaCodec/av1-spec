### Loop Filter

When we are using lossy compression the quantization means that errors are
introduced into the decoded data. For example, suppose we have some source data:

|       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 100   | 102   | 104   | 106   | 108   | 110   | 112   | 114   |
| 100   | 102   | 104   | 106   | 108   | 110   | 112   | 114   |
| 100   | 102   | 104   | 106   | 108   | 110   | 112   | 114   |
| 100   | 102   | 104   | 106   | 108   | 110   | 112   | 114   |

but due to lossy compression this decodes as two flat blocks:

|       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 103   | 103   | 103   | 103   | 111   | 111   | 111   | 111   |
| 103   | 103   | 103   | 103   | 111   | 111   | 111   | 111   |
| 103   | 103   | 103   | 103   | 111   | 111   | 111   | 111   |
| 103   | 103   | 103   | 103   | 111   | 111   | 111   | 111   |

Each of the individual 4x4 blocks looks reasonably close to the original, but
the discontinuity in the middle stands out. This is quite a common problem and
block edges appear in the decoded images.

To reduce the impact of these errors, a process called the loop filter is
applied to the block edges in the image. This process filters the image pixels
across the block boundaries in an attempt to smooth off such sudden
discontinuities. The block boundaries that are filtered include both the edges
between transform blocks and the edges between different mode info blocks.

This process is known as an in-loop filter because the filtered versions of
frames are used for reference in inter prediction.
