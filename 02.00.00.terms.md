| 2.23    | **Frame context:** A set of probabilities used in the decoding process.
| 2.24    | **Golden frame:** A frame that can be used in inter coding. Typically the golden frame is encoded with higher quality and is used as a reference for multiple inter frames.
| 2.25    | **Inter coding:** Coding one block or frame using inter prediction.
| 2.26    | **Inter frame:** A frame compressed by referencing previously decoded frames and which may use intra prediction or inter prediction.
| 2.27    | **Inter prediction:** The process of deriving the prediction value for the current frame using previously decoded frames.
| 2.28    | **Intra coding:** Coding one block or frame using intra prediction.
| 2.29    | **Intra frame:** A frame compressed using only intra prediction which can be independently decoded.
| 2.30    | **Intra-only frame:** A type of intra frame that does not reset the decoding process. _**Note:** A key frame is different to an intra-only frame even though both only use intra prediction. The difference is that a key frame fully resets the decoding process._

| 2.32    | **Inverse transform:** The process in which a transform coefficient matrix is transformed into a spatial sample value matrix.

| 2.37    | **Mode info:** A header describing one or more blocks. Blocks of size 8x8 and larger are described with a single mode info header. Blocks of size less than 8x8 share a mode info header that covers the whole 8x8 block of luma samples.
| 2.38    | **Mode info block:** A luma sample value block of size 8x8 or larger and its two corresponding chroma sample value blocks. A mode info block has a single mode info header.
| 2.39    | **Motion vector:** A two-dimensional vector used for inter prediction which refers the current frame to the reference frame, the value of which provides the coordinate offsets from a location in the current frame to a location in the reference frame.
| 2.40    | **Parse:** The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.
| 2.41    | **Prediction:** The implementation of the prediction process consisting of either inter or intra prediction.
| 2.42    | **Prediction process:** The process of estimating the decoded sample value or data element using a predictor.
| 2.43    | **Prediction value:** The value, which is the combination of the previously decoded sample values or data elements, used in the decoding process of the next sample value or data element.
| 2.44    | **Profile:** A subset of syntax, semantics and algorithms defined in a part.
| 2.45    | **Quantization parameter:** A variable used for scaling the quantized coefficients in the decoding process.
| 2.46    | **Quantized coefficient:** A transform coefficient before dequantization.
| 2.47    | **Raster scan:** Maps a two dimensional rectangular raster into a one dimensional raster, in which the entry of the one dimensional raster starts from the first row of the two dimensional raster, and the scanning then goes through the second row and the third row, and so on. Each raster row is scanned in left to right order.
| 2.48    | **Reconstruction:** Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding prediction values.
| 2.49    | **Reference frame:** A previously decoded frame used during inter prediction.
| 2.50    | **Reserved:** A special syntax element value which may be used to extend this part in the future.
| 2.51    | **Residual:** The differences between the reconstructed samples and the corresponding prediction values.
| 2.52    | **Sample:** The basic elements that compose the frame.
| 2.53    | **Sample value:** The value of a sample. This is an integer from 0 to 255 (inclusive) for 8-bit frames, from 0 to 1023 (inclusive) for 10-bit frames, and from 0 to 4095 (inclusive) for 12-bit frames.
| 2.54    | **Segmentation map:** a 3-bit number containing the segment affiliation for each 8x8 block in the image. The segmentation map persists across frames.
| 2.55    | **Sequence:** The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or several consecutive coded frames.
| 2.56    | **Subblock:** A 4x4, 4x8, or 8x4 block. All the subblocks within an 8x8 block share a single mode info header.
| 2.57    | **Superblock:** A square block of 64x64 pixels that consists of either 1 or 2 mode info blocks or is recursively partitioned into 4 32x32 blocks, which themselves can be further partitioned.
| 2.58    | **Superframe:** a chunk of data containing one or more coded frames plus an index at the end describing the number and sizes of the coded frames.
| 2.59    | **Syntax element:** An element of data represented in the bitstream.
| 2.60    | **Tile:** a rectangular region of the frame that is intended to be able to be decoded and encoded independently, although loop-filtering across tile edges may still be applied. _**Note:** For AV1 this intention is only partially met. Partitioning into columns works as expected, but partitioning into rows does not. The decode of a tile depends on the decode of the tile above._
| 2.61    | Transform block:** A square transform coefficient matrix, used as input to the inverse transform process.
| 2.62    | **Transform coefficient:** A scalar value, considered to be in a frequency domain, contained in a transform block.
