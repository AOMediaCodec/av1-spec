### Motion Vector Prediction

Quite often many blocks share the same motion vector (e.g. with a panning
camera). AV1 takes advantage of this by scanning already decoded inter blocks
to form a prediction of the most likely motion vectors that will be used for
the current block. It prefers blocks that are nearby and share the same choice
of reference frame, but gradually expands its search scope until it has found
up to 2 different predictions. When the spatial neighbors do not provide
sufficient information, it can fall back to using the motion vectors from the
previous decoded frame. The first found motion vector is called nearest motion
vector, and the second found motion vector is called near motion vector
(nearmv).

The block contains the **inter mode** which indicates whether to use the
nearest or near motion vector, or to use a zero motion vector, or to use a new
motion vector.

In the new motion vector case, what is coded in the bitstream is a motion
vector difference. The decoder reads this motion vector difference and adds it
to the nearest motion vector to compute the actual motion vector.

The effective motion vector can be specified at up to 1/8 (one eighth) pixel
accuracy. When the predicted motion vector has either component whose magnitude
is above 64 (i.e., 8 full pixels), the maximum accuracy of the effective motion
vector is automatically capped at 1/4 (one quarter) pixel accuracy.
