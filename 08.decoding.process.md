## Decoding Process


### General

Decoders shall produce output frames that are identical in all respects and have the same output order as
those produced by the decoding process specified herein.

The input to this process is a sequence of open bitstream units (OBUs).

The output from this process is a sequence of decoded frames.

For each OBU in turn the syntax elements are extracted as specified in [section 5.1][].

The syntax tables include function calls indicating when the remaining block decode processes are triggered.

### Decode Frame Process

This process is triggered by a call to decode_frame from within the syntax tables.

If show_existing_frame is equal to 0, the process first performs any post processing filtering by the following ordered steps:

  1. If loop_filter_level[ 0 ] is not equal to 0 or loop_filter_level[ 1 ] is not equal to 0, the loop
     filter process specified in [section 7.10][] is invoked once the coded frame has been decoded.
     
  2. The CDEF process specified in [section 7.11][] is invoked.
  
  3. The loop restoration process specified in [section 7.13][] is invoked.
     
  4.  The reference frame update process as specified in [section 7.15][] is
     invoked.
    
If show_existing_frame is equal to 1 or show_frame is equal to 1, the output process as specified in [section 7.14][] is invoked.

### Frame Order Constraints

This section describes additional constraints on a bitstream that result from
the choice of frame types.

If a sequence starts with a key frame, then the additional constraints are
automatically satisfied.

Otherwise, the sequence can start with a number of non key frames
and extra care has to be taken to ensure that
the decoding process is well defined. It is a requirement of bitstream
conformance that the following applies:

  * When ref_frame_idx[ i ] is decoded, it must identify an initialized
    reference frame, i.e. there must have been an earlier decoded frame which
    had (refresh_frame_flags \>\> ref_frame_idx[ i ])&1 equal to 1.

**Note:** This constraint means that the first coded frame cannot be an inter
frame.

### CDF Update Process

This process is triggered when the function update_cdf is called from
the tile group syntax table.

The frame CDF arrays are set equal to the final tile CDF arrays for the largest tile (measured in bytes) as follows.

A copy is made of the saved CDF values for each of the
CDF arrays mentioned in the semantics for setup_past_independence. 
The name of the destination for the copy is the name of the CDF array
with no prefix.  The name of the source for the copy is the name of the CDF array
prefixed with "Saved".
For example, the array YModeCdf will be updated with values equal to the contents of SavedYModeCdf.

### Motion Field Estimation Process

This process is triggered during the call to load_previous.

A linear projection model is employed to create a motion field estimation that is able
to capture high velocity temporal motion trajectories.

The motion field is estimated based on the saved motion vectors from the reference frames
and the relative frame distances.

As the frame distances depend on the frame being referenced, a separate motion field
is estimated for each reference frame used by the current frame.

A stack of up to three motion vectors (for each reference frame type) is prepared at each location on an 8x8 pixel grid.

The variable w8 (representing the width of the motion field in units of 8x8 pixels) is set equal to MiCols \>\> 1.

The variable h8 (representing the height of the motion field in units of 8x8 pixels) is set equal to MiRows \>\> 1.

As the linear projection can create a field with holes, the motion fields are initialized
to an invalid motion vector of -32768, -32768 as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( ref = LAST_FRAME; ref <= ALTREF_FRAME; ref++ )
    for ( y = 0; y < h8 ; y++ )
        for ( x = 0; x < w8; x++ )
            for ( i = 0; i < MFMV_STACK_SIZE; i++ )
                for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ )
                    MotionFieldMvs[ ref ][ y ][ x ][ i ][ j ] = -1 << 15
~~~~~

The variable curAltDecodeOrder (representing the decode order for ALTREF_FRAME of the current frame) is set equal to DecodeOrders[ ALTREF_FRAME ].

If ( curAltDecodeOrder < DecodeOrder ), then this process terminates immediately.

The variable refStamp (representing where in the stack to place projected motion vectors) is set equal to MFMV_STACK_SIZE - 1.

The variable lastIdx (representing which reference frame is used for LAST_FRAME) is set equal to ref_frame_idx[ 0 ].

The variable curGoldDecodeOrder (representing the decode order for GOLDEN_FRAME of the current frame) is set equal to DecodeOrders[ GOLDEN_FRAME ].

The variable lastAltDecodeOrder ( representing the decode order for ALTREF_FRAME of LAST_FRAME) is set equal to SavedDecodeOrders[ lastIdx ][ ALTREF_FRAME ].

The variable useLast (representing whether to project the motion vectors from LAST_FRAME) is set equal to ( lastAltDecodeOrder != curGoldDecodeOrder ).

If useLast is equal to 1, the forward projection process in [section 7.5.1][] is invoked with src equal to LAST_FRAME, and refStamp as inputs.

The variable refStamp is set equal to MFMV_STACK_SIZE - 2.

**Note:** refStamp is decreased even if the forward projection process is not invoked.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The variable useBwd is set equal to ( DecodeOrders[ BWDREF_FRAME ] > DecodeOrder ).

If useBwd is equal to 1, the backward projection process in [section 7.5.2][] is invoked with src equal to BWDREF_FRAME, and refStamp as inputs.

If useBwd is equal to 1, refStamp is set equal to refStamp - 1.

The variable useAlt2 is set equal to ( DecodeOrders[ ALTREF2_FRAME ] > DecodeOrder ).

If useAlt2 is equal to 1, the backward projection process in [section 7.5.2][] is invoked with src equal to ALTREF2_FRAME, and refStamp as inputs.

If useAlt2 is equal to 1, refStamp is set equal to refStamp - 1.

The variable useAlt is set equal to ( DecodeOrders[ ALTREF_FRAME ] > DecodeOrder ).

If useAlt is equal to 1 and (refStamp >= 0), the backward projection process in [section 7.5.2][] is invoked with src equal to ALTREF_FRAME, and refStamp as inputs.

#### Forward Projection Process

The inputs to this process are:

  - a variable src specifying which reference frame's motion vectors should be projected,

  - a variable refStamp specifying which entry in the stack to store the motion vectors.
  
The process projects the motion vectors from a whole reference frame (which will always be LAST_FRAME) and stores the results in MotionFieldMvs.

The variable srcIdx (representing which reference frame is used) is set equal to ref_frame_idx[ src - LAST_FRAME ].

The variable w8 (representing the width of the motion field in units of 8x8 pixels) is set equal to MiCols \>\> 1.

The variable h8 (representing the height of the motion field in units of 8x8 pixels) is set equal to MiRows \>\> 1.

The process is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( y8 = 0; y8 < h8; y8++ ) {
    for ( x8 = 0; x8 < w8; x8++ ) {
        row = 2 * y8 + 1
        col = 2 * x8 + 1
        srcRef = SavedRefFrames[ srcIdx ][ row ][ col ][ 0 ]
        if ( check_forward( srcRef ) ) {
            mv = SavedMvs[ srcIdx ][ row ][ col ][ 0 ]
            projMv = get_mv_projection( mv, srcRef, src, src ) 
            posValid = get_block_position( y8, x8, projMv, 1 )
            if ( posValid ) {
                for ( dst = LAST_FRAME; dst <= GOLDEN_FRAME; dst++ ) {
                    projMv = get_mv_projection( mv, srcRef, src, dst )
                    MotionFieldMvs[ dst ][ PosY8 ][ PosX8 ][ refStamp ] = projMv
                }
            }
        }
        for ( idx = 0; idx < 2; idx++ ) {
            srcRef = SavedRefFrames[ srcIdx ][ row ][ col ][ idx ]
            if ( check_backward( srcRef ) ) {
                mv = SavedMvs[ srcIdx ][ row ][ col ][ idx ]
                projMv = get_mv_projection( mv, srcRef, src, src ) 
                posValid = get_block_position( y8, x8, projMv, 0 )
                if ( posValid ) {
                    for ( dst = BWDREF_FRAME; dst <= ALTREF_FRAME; dst++ ) {
                        projMv = get_mv_projection( mv, srcRef, src, dst )
                        MotionFieldMvs[ dst ][ PosY8 ][ PosX8 ][ refStamp ] = projMv
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

When the function get_mv_projection is called, the get mv position process specified in [section 7.5.3][] is invoked with mv, src, dst as inputs and the output assigned to projMv.

When the function get_block_position is called, the get block position process specified in [section 7.5.4][] is invoked and the output assigned to posValid.
This process also sets up the variables PosY8 and PosX8 representing the projected location in the motion field.

**Note:** The forward projections from LAST_FRAME can use both list0 and list1 motion vectors.
The backward projections only use list0 motion vectors.
{:.alert .alert-info }

#### Backward Projection Process

The inputs to this process are:

  - a variable src specifying which reference frame's motion vectors should be projected,

  - a variable refStamp specifying which entry in the stack to store the motion vectors.
  
The process projects the motion vectors from a whole reference frame (which will always be one of the backward reference types) and stores the results in MotionFieldMvs.

The variable srcIdx (representing which reference frame is used) is set equal to ref_frame_idx[ src - LAST_FRAME ].

The variable w8 (representing the width of the motion field in units of 8x8 pixels) is set equal to MiCols \>\> 1.

The variable h8 (representing the height of the motion field in units of 8x8 pixels) is set equal to MiRows \>\> 1.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that srcIdx refers to a frame of the same
width and height as the current frame.
In other words, when this process is invoked, both of the following must be true:

  * RefFrameWidth[ srcIdx ] is equal to FrameWidth.
  
  * RefFrameHeight[ srcIdx ] is equal to FrameHeight.

The process is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( y8 = 0; y8 < h8; y8++ ) {
    for ( x8 = 0; x8 < w8; x8++ ) {
        row = 2 * y8 + 1
        col = 2 * x8 + 1
        srcRef = SavedRefFrames[ srcIdx ][ row ][ col ][ 0 ]
        if ( check_forward( srcRef ) ) {
            mv = SavedMvs[ srcIdx ][ row ][ col ][ 0 ]
            projMv = get_mv_projection( mv, srcRef, src, src )
            posValid = get_block_position( y8, x8, projMv, 0 )
            if ( posValid ) {
                for ( dst = LAST_FRAME; dst <= ALTREF_FRAME; dst++ ) {
                    projMv = get_mv_projection( mv, srcRef, src, dst )
                    if ( check_backward( dst ) ) {
                        projMv[ 0 ] = -projMv[ 0 ]
                        projMv[ 1 ] = -projMv[ 1 ]
                    }
                    MotionFieldMvs[ dst ][ PosY8 ][ PosX8 ][ refStamp ] = projMv
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

When the function get_mv_projection is called, the get mv position process specified in [section 7.5.3][] is invoked with mv, src, dst as inputs and the output assigned to projMv.

When the function get_block_position is called, the get block position process specified in [section 7.5.4][] is invoked and the output assigned to posValid.
This process also sets up the variables PosY8 and PosX8 representing the projected location in the motion field.

#### Get MV Position Process

The inputs to this process are:

  - a length two array mv specifying a motion vector,
  
  - a variable ref specifying the reference frame associated with the motion vector,
  
  - a variable src specifying which reference frame's motion vectors should be projected,
  
  - a variable dst specifying which reference frame to target when adjusting the motion vector.
  
The outputs of this process are:

  - a length 2 array projMv containing a projected motion vector
  
This process starts with a motion vector mv from a previous frame (src).
This motion vector gives the displacement expected when moving a certain number of frames (between src and ref).
We wish to use the motion vector for predictions using a different reference frame (dst), so we need to scale the length of the motion vector.

The variable srcIdx (representing the reference frame where we obtained the motion vector) is set equal to ref_frame_idx[ src - LAST_FRAME ].

The variable srcDecodeOrder (representing the decode order of the reference frame where we obtained the motion vector) is set equal to DecodeOrders[ src ].

The variable refDecodeOrder (representing the decode order of the frame referenced by the motion vector) is set equal to SavedDecodeOrders[ srcIdx ][ ref ].

The variable refSign is set equal to ( check_backward( ref ) ? -1 : 1 ).

The variable mvOffset (representing the number of frames covered by the motion vector) is set equal to Max( 1, refSign * (srcDecodeOrder - refDecodeOrder) ).

The variable dstDecodeOrder (representing the decode order of the reference frame we wish to use) is set equal to DecodeOrders[ dst ].

The variable dstSign is set equal to ( check_backward( dst ) ? -1 : 1 ).

The variable dstOffset (representing the number of frames that we wish the motion vector to cover) is set equal to dstSign * (DecodeOrder - dstDecodeOrder).

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that mvOffset and dstOffset are in the range -31 to 31.

The projected motion vector is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( i = 0; i < 2; i++ )
    projMv[ i ] = Round2Signed( mv[ i ] * dstOffset * Div_Mult[ mvOffset ], 14 )
~~~~~

where Div_Mult is a constant lookup table specified as:

~~~~~ c
Div_Mult[32] = {
  0,    16384, 8192, 5461, 4096, 3276, 2730, 2340, 2048, 1820, 1638,
  1489, 1365,  1260, 1170, 1092, 1024, 963,  910,  862,  819,  780,
  744,  712,   682,  655,  630,  606,  585,  564,  546,  528
}
~~~~~

#### Get Block Position Process

The inputs to this process are:

  - variables x8 and y8 specifying a location in units of 8x8 pixels,
  
  - a length two array projMv specifying a projected motion vector,
  
  - a flag signBias specifying if we should project the block in the direction of the motion vector (signBias equal to 0), or in the reverse direction (signBias equal to 1).
  
The process generates global variables PosX8 and PosY8 representing the projected location in units of 8x8 pixels.

The process returns a flag posValid that indicates if the position should be used.

**Note:** posValid is specified such that only blocks within a certain distance of the current location
need to be projected.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The variable posValid is set equal to 1.

The variable PosY8 is set equal to project(y8, projMv[ 0 ], MiRows \>\> 1, MAX_OFFSET_HEIGHT, signBias).

The variable PosX8 is set equal to project(x8, projMv[ 1 ], MiCols \>\> 1, MAX_OFFSET_WIDTH, signBias).

where the function project is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
project( v8, delta, max8, maxOff8, signBias ) {
    base8 = (v8 >> 3) << 3
    if (delta >= 0) {
        offset8 = delta >> ( 3 + 1 + MI_SIZE_LOG2 )
    } else {
        offset8 = -( ( -delta ) >> ( 3 + 1 + MI_SIZE_LOG2 ) )
    }
    if ( signBias )
        v8 -= offset8
    else
        v8 += offset8
    if ( v8 < 0 || 
         v8 >= max8 || 
         v8 <= base8 - maxOff8 ||
         v8 >= base8 + 8 + maxOff8 ) {
        posValid = 0
    }
    return v8
}
~~~~~

The project function clears posValid if the resulting position is offset too far.

### Motion Vector Prediction Processes

The following sections define the processes used for predicting the motion vectors.

These processes are triggered at points defined by function calls to find_mv_list, compound_context, and find_mv_stack
in the inter block mode info syntax described in [section 5.8.20][].

#### Find MV List Process

The input to this process is a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict.

This process is triggered by a function call to find_mv_list and constructs an array RefListMv[ refList ] containing 2 motion vector candidates.

The setup zero mv process specified in [section 7.6.1.1][] is invoked with the input refList and the output is assigned to ZeroMvs[ refList ].

The array RefListMv[ refList ] is first initialized to have both entries equal to ZeroMvs[ refList ].

The variable NumMvFound (representing the number of candidates found during this process) is set equal to 0.

The variable bw8 (representing the width of the block in units of 8 pixels) is set equal to Num_8x8_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The variable bh8 (representing the height of the block in units of 8 pixels) is set equal to Num_8x8_Blocks_High[ MiSize ].

An array offMvs8 (representing offsets in units of 8 pixels to search locations) is defined as:

~~~~~ c
offMvs8[ 9 ][ 2 ] = {
  { bh8 - 1, -1 },
  { -1, bw8 - 1 },
  { -1, (bw8 - 1) >> 1 },
  { (bh8 - 1) >> 1, -1 },
  { -1, -1 },
  { -1, ( bw8 == bh8 ) ? 0 : bw8 },
  { ( bw8 == bh8 ) ? 0 : bh8, -1 },
  { -1, -3 },
  { bh8 - 1, -3 }
}
~~~~~

The motion vector candidates are constructed by the following ordered steps :

1. For i = 0..8 the spatial motion vector candidate process in [section 7.6.1.1][] is invoked with mv8 equal to offMvs8[ i ], same equal to 1, and refList as inputs.

2. For i = 0..8 the spatial motion vector candidate process in [section 7.6.1.1][] is invoked with mv8 equal to offMvs8[ i ], same equal to 0, and refList as inputs.


##### Setup Zero MV Process

The input to this process is a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict.

The output is a motion vector mv representing global motion for this block.

The variable ref (specifying the reference frame) is set equal to RefFrame[ refList ].

The variable typ (specifying the type of global motion) is set equal to gm_type[ ref ].

The variable bw (representing the width of the block in units of pixels) is set equal to Block_Width[ MiSize ].

The variable bh (representing the height of the block in units of pixels) is set equal to Block_Height[ MiSize ].

The output motion vector mv is specified by projecting the central pixel of the block as follows:

~~~~~ c
if (typ == IDENTITY) {
    mv[0] = 0
    mv[1] = 0
} else if (typ == TRANSLATION) {
    mv[0] = gm_params[ref][0] >> (WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 3)
    mv[1] = gm_params[ref][1] >> (WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 3)
} else {
    x = MiCol * MI_SIZE + bw / 2 - 1
    y = MiRow * MI_SIZE + bh / 2 - 1
    xc = (gm_params[ref][2] - (1 << WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS)) * x +
          gm_params[ref][3] * y +
          gm_params[ref][0]
    yc =  gm_params[ref][4] * x +
         (gm_params[ref][5] - (1 << WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS)) * y +
          gm_params[ref][1]
    if (allow_high_precision_mv) {
      mv[0] = Round2Signed(xc, WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 3)
      mv[1] = Round2Signed(yc, WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 3)
    } else {
      mv[0] = Round2Signed(xc, WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 2) * 2
      mv[1] = Round2Signed(yc, WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 2) * 2
    }
}
lower_mv_precision( mv )
~~~~~

where the call to lower_mv_precision invokes the lower precision process specified in [section 7.6.3.9][].

##### Spatial Motion Vector Candidate Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a 2 element array mv8 specifying the offset in 8 pixel units to the candidate location,
  
  * a variable same specifying whether to only look for candidates with matching reference frame,
  
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict.
  
This process examines the motion vector at a position in the current frame and adds it to the candidate list if certain conditions are met.
  
The candidate location in 4x4 pixel units is derived as:

  * the variable mvRow is set equal to MiRow + 2 * mv8[0]
  
  * the variable mvCol is set equal to MiCol + 2 * mv8[1]
  
The variable size (representing the size of the superblock in units of 4x4 pixels) is set as follows:

  * If use_128x128_superblock is equal to 1, size is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ BLOCK_128X128 ].
  
  * Otherwise (use_128x128_superblock is equal to 0), size is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ BLOCK_64X64 ].
  
This process terminates immediately if any of the following are true:

  * the function is_inside( mvRow, mvCol ) is equal to 0 (this tests if the candidate is in a different tile from which we are not allowed to retrieve motion vectors)
  
  * (MiRow % size) +  2 * mv8[0] is greater than or equal to size (this tests if the candidate comes from the superblock row below)
  
  * (MiCol % size) +  2 * mv8[1] is greater than or equal to size (this tests if the candidate comes from the superblock column to the right)
  
  * RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 0 ] has not yet been written for this frame (this tests if the candidate location has not been decoded yet)
  
For list=0..1 the following ordered steps apply:

1. The variable candRef is set equal to RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ list ]
2. The 2 element array candMv is set to a copy of Mvs[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ list ]
3. Invoke the candidate add process in [section 7.6.1.3][] with candRef, candMv, same, refList as inputs.


##### Candidate Add Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a 2 element array candMv specifying the candidate motion vector,
  
  * a variable candRef specifying the candidate reference frame,
  
  * a variable same specifying whether to only look for candidates with matching reference frame,
  
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict.
  
This process terminates immediately if same is equal to 1 and candRef is not equal to RefFrame[refList].

This process terminates immediately if NumMvFound is equal to 2 (this means we have already found enough motion vector candidates).

If ref_frame_sign_bias[ candRef ] is not equal to ref_frame_sign_bias[ RefFrame[refList] ], then the candidate motion vector is inverted as follows:

  * candMv[ 0 ] *= -1
  * candMv[ 1 ] *= -1
  
The variable bw (representing the width of the block rounded up to be a multiple of 8) is set equal to 8 * Num_8x8_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The variable bh (representing the height of the block rounded up to be a multiple of 8) is set equal to 8 * Num_8x8_Blocks_High[ MiSize ]. 

The motion vector is clamped to a legal range as follows:

  * candMv[ 0 ] is set equal to clamp_mv_row( candMv[ 0 ], MV_BORDER + bh * 8)
  * candMv[ 1 ] is set equal to clamp_mv_col( candMv[ 1 ], MV_BORDER + bw * 8)
   
If NumMvFound is equal to 0 or candMv is not equal to RefListMv[ refList ][ 0 ], then the following ordered steps apply:

  1. RefListMv[ refList ][ NumMvFound ] is set equal to candMv
  2. NumMvFound is set equal to NumMvFound + 1
  
#### Compound Context Process

This process is triggered by a function call to compound_context and constructs a variable CompoundModeContext that is used for decoding the inter_mode syntax element.

The variable bw4 (representing the width of the block in units of 4 pixels) is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The variable bh4 (representing the height of the block in units of 4 pixels) is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ MiSize ].

An array offMvs4 (representing offsets in units of 4 pixels to search locations) is defined as:

~~~~~ c
offMvs4[ 2 ][ 2 ] = {
  {bh4 - 1, -1},
  {-1, bw4 - 1}
}
~~~~~

The CompoundModeContext is constructed by testing the mode of the neighbouring blocks at the top-right and bottom-left corners as follows:

~~~~~ c
counter = 0
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    mvRow = MiRow + offMvs4[i][0]
    mvCol = MiCol + offMvs4[i][1]
    if (is_inside(mvCol, mvRow)) {
        counter += Mode_To_Counter[ YModes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ] ]
    }
}
CompoundModeContext = Counter_To_Context[counter]
~~~~~

The Mode_To_Counter table is defined as:

~~~~~ c
Mode_To_Counter[ MB_MODE_COUNT ] = {
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 1
}
~~~~~

The Counter_To_Context table is defined as:

~~~~~ c
Counter_To_Context[ 19 ] = {
    BOTH_PREDICTED,
    NEW_PLUS_NON_INTRA,
    BOTH_NEW,
    ZERO_PLUS_PREDICTED,
    NEW_PLUS_NON_INTRA,
    INVALID_CASE,
    BOTH_ZERO,

#### Find MV Stack Process

This process is triggered by a function call to find_mv_stack.

The input to this process is a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction.

This process constructs an array RefStackMv containing motion vector candidates.
This is similar to the RefListMv list of motion vectors, except that the stack only contains candidates that exactly match
in their use of reference frames, while RefListMv can also include partial matches.  For single prediction, the candidates in
the stack are used to overwrite entries in RefListMv.

The process also prepares the value of the contexts used
when decoding inter prediction syntax elements.

The variable bw4 specifying the width of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The following ordered steps apply:

1. The variable NumMvFound (representing the number of motion vector candidates in RefStackMv) is set equal to 0.

1. The variable NumNewMvFound (representing the number of candidates in RefStackMv that used NEWMV encoding) is set equal to 0.

2. The scan row process in [section 7.6.3.1][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -1 and refList as inputs. 

3. The scan col process in [section 7.6.3.2][] is invoked with deltaCol equal to -1 and refList as inputs. 

4. The scan point process in [section 7.6.3.3][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -1, deltaCol equal to bw4, and refList as inputs. 

5. The variable numNearest (representing the number of motion vectors found in the immediate neighbourhood) is set equal to NumMvFound

5. The variable numNew (representing the number of NEWMV candidates found in the immediate neighbourhood) is set equal to NumNewMvFound

6. If numNearest is greater than 0, WeightStack[ idx ] is incremented by REF_CAT_LEVEL for idx = 0..(numNearest-1).

1. The variable ZeroMvContext is set equal to 0.

5. If refList is greater than or equal to 0 and can_use_previous is equal to 1,
the temporal scan process in [section 7.6.3.4][] is invoked with refList as input (the temporal scan process affects ZeroMvContext).

6. The scan point process in [section 7.6.3.3][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -1, deltaCol equal to -1, and refList as inputs. 

7. The scan row process in [section 7.6.3.1][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -3 and refList as inputs. 

8. The scan col process in [section 7.6.3.2][] is invoked with deltaCol equal to -3 and refList as inputs. 

9. The scan row process in [section 7.6.3.1][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -5 and refList as inputs. 

10. The scan col process in [section 7.6.3.2][] is invoked with deltaCol equal to -5 and refList as inputs. 

11. The scan col process in [section 7.6.3.2][] is invoked with deltaCol equal to -7 and refList as inputs.

12. The sorting process in [section 7.6.3.10][] is invoked with start equal to 0 and end equal to numNearest.

13. The sorting process in [section 7.6.3.10][] is invoked with start equal to numNearest and end equal to NumMvFound.

13. The context and clamping process in [section 7.6.3.11][] is invoked with refList, numNearest, and numNew as input.


##### Scan Row Process

The inputs to this process are:
  
  * a variable deltaRow specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) how far above to look for motion vectors,
  
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction.

The variable bw4 specifying the width of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The variable deltaCol is set equal to 0.

The variable useStep16 is set equal to (bw4 >= 16).  

**Note:** useStep16 is equal to 1 when the block is 64 pixels wide.  This means
only 4 locations will be searched in this case.  However, a 32 pixel wide block
may still search 8 locations.
{:.alert .alert-info }

If Abs(deltaRow) is greater than 1, the offset is adjusted as follows:

~~~~~ c
deltaRow += MiRow & 1
deltaCol = 1 - (MiCol & 1)
~~~~~

**Note:** These adjustments reduce the number of motion vectors that need to be
kept in memory
{:.alert .alert-info }

A series of motion vector locations is scanned as follows:

~~~~~ c
i = 0
while ( i < bw4 ) {
    mvRow = MiRow + deltaRow
    mvCol = MiCol + deltaCol + i
    if (!is_inside(mvRow,mvCol))
        break
    len = Min(bw4, Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSizes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ] ])
    if (Abs(deltaRow) > 1)
        len = Max(2, len)
    if (useStep16)
        len = Max(4, len)
    add_ref_mv_candidate( mvRow, mvCol, refList, len)
    i += len
}
~~~~~

where the call to add_ref_mv_candidate invokes the process in [section 7.6.3.6][].


##### Scan Col Process

The inputs to this process are:
  
  * a variable deltaCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) how far left to look for motion vectors,
  
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction.

The variable bh4 specifying the height of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ MiSize ].

The variable deltaRow is set equal to 0.

The variable useStep16 is set equal to (bh4 >= 16).

If Abs(deltaCol) is greater than 1, the offset is adjusted as follows:

~~~~~ c
deltaRow = 1 - (MiRow & 1)
deltaCol += MiCol & 1
~~~~~

A series of motion vector locations is scanned as follows:

~~~~~ c
i = 0
while ( i < bh4 ) {
    mvRow = MiRow + deltaRow + i
    mvCol = MiCol + deltaCol
    if (!is_inside(mvRow,mvCol))
        break
    len = Min(bh4, Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ MiSizes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ] ])
    if (Abs(deltaCol) > 1)
        len = Max(2, len)
    if (useStep16)
        len = Max(4, len)
    add_ref_mv_candidate( mvRow, mvCol, refList, len)
    i += len
}
~~~~~

where the call to add_ref_mv_candidate invokes the process in [section 7.6.3.6][].

##### Scan Point Process

The inputs to this process are:
  
  * a variable deltaRow specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) how far above to look for a motion vector,
  
  * a variable deltaCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) how far left to look for a motion vector,
 
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction.
  
The variable mvRow is set equal to MiRow + deltaRow.

The variable mvCol is set equal to MiCol + deltaCol.

The variable len is set equal to 8.

If is_inside( mvRow, mvCol ) is equal to 1
and RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 0 ] has been written for this frame (this checks that the candidate location has been decoded),
the add reference motion vector process in [section 7.6.3.6][] is invoked with mvRow, mvCol, refList, len as inputs.

##### Temporal Scan Process

The input to this process is a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict.

This process scans the motion vectors in a previous frame looking for candidates which use the same reference frame.

The variable bw4 specifying the width of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The variable bh4 specifying the height of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ MiSize ].
  
The process scans the locations within the block as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( deltaRow = 0; deltaRow < bh4 ; deltaRow += 2 ) {
    for ( deltaCol = 0; deltaCol < bw4 ; deltaCol += 2 ) {
        add_tpl_ref_mv( deltaRow, deltaCol, refList)
    }
}
~~~~~

where the call to add_tpl_ref_mv invokes the temporal sample process in [section 7.6.3.5][].

The process then scans positions around the block (but still within the same superblock) as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( i = 0; i < 9; i++ ) {
    deltaRow = tplSamplePos[ i ][ 0 ]
    deltaCol = tplSamplePos[ i ][ 1 ]
    if ( check_sb_border( deltaRow, deltaCol ) ) { 
        add_tpl_ref_mv( deltaRow, deltaCol, refList)
    }
}
~~~~~

where tplSamplePos contains the offsets to search (in units of 4x4 pixels) and is specified as:

~~~~~ c
voffset = Max(2, bh4)
hoffset = Max(2, bw4)
tplSamplePos[9][2] = {
    { -2, hoffset }, { 0, hoffset },  { voffset, hoffset },
    { voffset, 0 },  { voffset, -2 }, { voffset, -4 },
    { -4, hoffset }, { voffset, 4 },  { 2, hoffset + 4 },
}
~~~~~

and check_sb_border checks that the position is within the same superblock as follows:

~~~~~ c
check_sb_border( deltaRow, deltaCol ) {
    sbSize = use_128x128_superblock ? BLOCK_128X128 : BLOCK_64X64
    sbSize4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ sbSize ]
    row = (MiRow % sbSize4) + deltaRow 
    col = (MiCol % sbSize4) + deltaCol
    
    return ( row >= 0 && row < sbSize4 && col >= 0 && col < sbSize4 )
}
~~~~~

##### Temporal Sample Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * variables deltaRow and deltaCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) the offset to the candidate location,
 
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction.

This process looks up a motion vector from the motion field and adds it into the stack.

The variable mvRow is set equal to (MiRow + deltaRow) \| 1.

The variable mvCol is set equal to (MiCol + deltaCol) \| 1.

If is_inside( mvRow, mvCol ) is equal to 0, this process terminates immediately.

The variable x8 is set equal to mvCol \>\> 1.

The variable y8 is set equal to mvRow \>\> 1.

(x8 and y8 represent the position of the candidate in units of 8x8 pixels.)

The process is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
foundValidMv = 0
if ( refList >= 0 ) {
    for ( i = 0; i < MFMV_STACK_SIZE; i++ ) {
        candMv = MotionFieldMvs[ RefFrame[ refList ] ][ y8 ][ x8 ][ i ]

        lower_mv_precision( candMv )
        if ( deltaRow == 0 && deltaCol == 0 ) {
            if ( Abs( candMv[ 0 ] ) >= 16 || Abs( candMv[ 1 ] ) >= 16 )
                ZeroMvContext = 1
        }
        for ( idx = 0; idx < NumMvFound; idx++ ) {
            if ( Abs( candMv[ 0 ] - RefStackMv[ idx ][ 0 ][ 0 ] ) < 4 &&
                 Abs( candMv[ 1 ] - RefStackMv[ idx ][ 0 ][ 1 ] ) < 4 )

                ZeroMvContext = 1
        }
        for ( idx = 0; idx < NumMvFound; idx++ ) {
            if ( Abs( candMv0[ 0 ] - RefStackMv[ idx ][ 0 ][ 0 ] ) < 4 &&

~~~~~

where the call to lower_mv_precision invokes the lower precision process specified in [section 7.6.3.9][].

**Note:** The motion field does not store values for PredMv, so the PredStackMv values
are constructed as a simple offset of the candidate motion vectors.

##### Add Reference Motion Vector Process

The inputs to this process are:
  
  * variables mvRow and mvCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) the candidate location,
 
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction,
  
  * a variable len specifying the weight attached to this motion vector.
  
This process examines the candidate to find matching reference frames.

If refList is greater than or equal to 0, the following applies for candList = 0..1:

1. if RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ candList ] is equal to RefFrame[ refList ], the search stack process in [section 7.6.3.7][] is invoked with mvRow, mvCol, len, candList, refList as inputs

Otherwise (refList is equal to -1), the following applies:

1. if RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 0 ] is equal to RefFrame[ 0 ] and RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 1 ] is equal to RefFrame[ 1 ],
the compound search stack process in [section 7.6.3.8][] is invoked with mvRow, mvCol, refList, len as inputs

##### Search Stack Process

The inputs to this process are:
  
  * variables mvRow and mvCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) the candidate location,
  
  * a variable candList specifying which list in the candidate matches our reference frame,
  
  * a variable len specifying the weight attached to this motion vector,
  
  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict.
  
This process adds motion vectors to the stack if they are not already present.

The variable candMode is set equal to YModes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ].

The variable candSize is set equal to MiSizes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ].

The variable large is set equal to ( Min( Block_Width[ candSize ],Block_Height[ candSize ] ) >= 8 ).

The candidate motion vector candMv is set as follows:

  * If ( candMode == GLOBALMV \|\| candMode == GLOBAL_GLOBALMV) and ( gm_type[ RefFrame[ refList ] ] > TRANSLATION ) and ( large == 1 ), candMv is set equal to ZeroMvs[ refList ].
  
  * Otherwise, candMv is set equal to Mvs[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ candList ].

The lower precision process specified in [section 7.6.3.9][] is invoked with candMv.

The variable weight is set equal to len * 2.

The process depends on whether the candidate motion vector is already in the stack as follows:

  * If candMv is already equal to RefStackMv[ idx ][ 0 ] for some idx less than NumMvFound, then WeightStack[ idx ] is increased by weight
  
  * Otherwise, if NumMvFound is less than MAX_REF_MV_STACK_SIZE, the following ordered steps apply:
   
     a. RefStackMv[ NumMvFound ][ 0 ] is set equal to candMv
     
     b. PredStackMv[ NumMvFound ][ 0 ] is set equal to PredMvs[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 0 ]
     
     c. WeightStack[ NumMvFound ] is set equal to weight
     
     d. NumMvFound is set equal to NumMvFound + 1.
     
     e. If candMode is equal to NEWMV, NumNewMvFound is set equal to NumNewMvFound + 1.
     
  * Otherwise, (NumMvFound is greater than or equal to MAX_REF_MV_STACK_SIZE), the process has no effect.

##### Compound Search Stack Process

The inputs to this process are:
  
  * variables mvRow and mvCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) the candidate location,
  
  * a variable candList specifying which list in the candidate matches our reference frame,
  
  * a variable len specifying the weight attached to this motion vector,
  
This process adds motion vectors to the stack if they are not already present.

The array candMvs (containing two motion vectors) is set equal to Mvs[ mvRow ][ mvCol ].

The variable candMode is set equal to YModes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ].

The variable candSize is set equal to MiSizes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ].

The variable large is set equal to ( Min( Block_Width[ candSize ],Block_Height[ candSize ] ) >= 8 ).

If candMode is equal to GLOBAL_GLOBALMV and large is equal to 1, for refList = 0..1 the following applies:

  * If gm_type[ RefFrame[ refList ] ] > TRANSLATION, candMvs[ refList ] is set equal to ZeroMvs[ refList ].

For i = 0..1, the lower precision process specified in [section 7.6.3.9][] is invoked with candMvs[ i ].

The variable weight is set equal to len * 2.

The process depends on whether the candidate motion vector is already in the stack as follows:

  * If candMvs[ 0 ] is equal to RefStackMv[ idx ][ 0 ] and candMvs[ 1 ] is equal to RefStackMv[ idx ][ 1 ] for some idx less than NumMvFound, then WeightStack[ idx ] is increased by weight
  
  * Otherwise, if NumMvFound is less than MAX_REF_MV_STACK_SIZE, the following ordered steps apply:
   
     a. RefStackMv[ NumMvFound ][ i ] is set equal to candMvs[ i ] for i = 0..1
     
     b. PredStackMv[ NumMvFound ][ i ] is set equal to PredMvs[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ i ] for i = 0..1
     
     b. WeightStack[ NumMvFound ] is set equal to weight
     
     c. NumMvFound is set equal to NumMvFound + 1.
     
  * Otherwise, (NumMvFound is greater than or equal to MAX_REF_MV_STACK_SIZE), the process has no effect.
  
NumNewMvFound is incremented by 1 if all of the following are true:

  * NumMvFound is increased during this process
  
  * YModes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ] is equal to NEW_NEWMV
  
##### Lower Precision Process

The input to this process is a reference candMv to a motion vector array.

This process modifies the contents of the input motion vector to remove the least significant bit when high precision is not allowed,
and all three fractional bits when force_integer_mv is equal to 1.

If allow_high_precision_mv is equal to 1, this process terminates immediately.

For i = 0..1, the following applies:

~~~~~ c
if (force_integer_mv) {
    a = Abs( candMv[ i ] )
    aInt = (a + 3) >> 3
    if (candMv[ i ] > 0)
        candMv[ i ] = aInt << 3
    else
        candMv[ i ] = -( aInt << 3 )
} else {
    if (candMv[ i ] & 1) {
        if (candMv[ i ] > 0)
            candMv[ i ]--
        else
            candMv[ i ]++
    }
}
~~~~~

##### Sorting Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable start representing the first position to be sorted,
  
  * a variable end representing the length of the array.
  
This process performs a stable sort of part of the stack of motion vectors according to the corresponding weight.

Entries in RefStackMv from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive) are sorted.

The sorting process is specified as:

~~~~~ c
while ( end > start ) {
    newEnd = start
    for ( idx = start + 1; idx < end; idx++ ) {
        if ( WeightStack[ idx - 1 ] < WeightStack[ idx ] ) {
            swap(idx - 1, idx)
            newEnd = idx
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

When the function swap is invoked, the entries at locations idx and idx - 1 should be swapped in each of the following arrays:

  * WeightStack
  * RefStackMv
  * PredStackMv
  
##### Context and Clamping Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable refList specifying which set of motion vectors to predict, or -1 to signal compound prediction,
  
  * a variable numNearest specifying the number of candidates found in the immediate neighbourhood,
  
  * a variable numNew specifying the number of NEWMV candidates found in the immediate neighbourhood.

This process computes contexts to be used when decoding syntax elements, and overwrites the entries in RefListMv with clamped candidates from RefStackMv.

The variable bw (representing the width of the block in units of pixels) is set equal to Block_Width[ MiSize ].

The variable bh (representing the height of the block in units of pixels) is set equal to Block_Height[ MiSize ].


The variable numLists specifying the number of reference frames used for this block is set equal to ( (refList < 0) ? 2 : 1 ).

The arrays DrlCtxStack and MvCtxStack contain one or two contexts (depending on whether we are doing single or compound prediction) for each entry in the stack.

The array MvCtxStack is set as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( list = 0; list < numLists; list++ ) {
    for ( idx = 0; idx < NumMvFound ; idx++ ) {
        refMv = RefStackMv[ idx ][ list ]
        predMv = PredStackMv[ idx ][ list ]
        v = 0
        if ( WeightStack[ idx ] >= REF_CAT_LEVEL ) {
            v = 2
            for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ ) {
                if ( Abs( refMv[ j ] - predMv[ j ] ) > 4 )
                    v = 1
            }
        }
        MvCtxStack[ idx ][ list ] = v
    }
}
~~~~~

The array DrlCtxStack is set as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( idx = 0; idx < NumMvFound ; idx++ ) {
    z = 0
    if ( idx + 1 < NumMvFound ) {
        w0 = WeightStack[ idx ]
        w1 = WeightStack[ idx + 1 ]
        if (w0 >= REF_CAT_LEVEL) {
            if (w1 < REF_CAT_LEVEL) {
                z = 2
            }
        } else {
            if (w1 < REF_CAT_LEVEL) {
                z = 3
            }
        }
    }      
    DrlCtxStack[ idx ] = z
}
~~~~~

**Note:** It is impossible for DrlCtxStack to contain the value 1.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The motion vectors are clamped and the variable AllZero is set as follows:

~~~~~ c
AllZero = 1
for ( list = 0; list < numLists; list++ ) {
    for ( idx = 0; idx < NumMvFound ; idx++ ) {
        refMv = RefStackMv[ idx ][ list ]
        refMv[ 0 ] = clamp_mv_row( refMv[ 0 ], MV_BORDER + bh * 8)
        refMv[ 1 ] = clamp_mv_col( refMv[ 1 ], MV_BORDER + bw * 8)
        if ( refList < 0 ) {
            RefStackMv[ idx ][ list ] = refMv

{:.alert .alert-info }

The variables RefMvContext and NewMvContext are set as follows:

#### Has Overlappable Candidates Process

This process is triggered by a call to has_overlappable_candidates.

It returns 1 to indicate that the block has neighbours
suitable for use by overlapped motion compensation, or 0 otherwise.

The process looks to see if there are any inter blocks to the left or above.

The check is only made at 8x8 granularity.

The process is specified as:

~~~~~ c
has_overlappable_candidates( ) {
  if ( AvailU ) {
    w4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ]
    for ( x4 = MiCol; x4 < Min( MiCols, MiCol + w4 ); x4 += 2 ) {

            return 1

  }
  return 0

#### Find Warp Samples Process

This process is triggered when the find_warp_samples function is invoked.

The process examines the neighbouring inter predicted blocks and estimates a local warp transformation based on the motion vectors.

The process produces a variable NumSamples containing the number of valid candidates found, and an array CandList containing sorted candidates.

The variable NumSamples is set equal to 0.

The variable w4 specifying the width of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ].

The variable h4 specifying the height of the block in 4x4 pixels is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ MiSize ].

The following ordered steps apply:

  1. The add sample process in [section 7.6.5.1][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -1, and deltaCol equal to 0..(w4 - 1) (this adds candidates above the current block).
  
  2. The add sample process in [section 7.6.5.1][] is invoked with deltaCol equal to -1, and deltaRow equal to 0..(h4 - 1) (this adds candidates to the left of the current block).

  3. The add sample process in [section 7.6.5.1][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -1, and deltaCol equal to -1 (this adds a candidate to the top left).
  
  4. The add sample process in [section 7.6.5.1][] is invoked with deltaRow equal to -1, and deltaCol equal to w4 (this adds a candidate to the top right).
  
  1. The sort sample process in [section 7.6.5.2][] is invoked.

##### Add Sample Process

The inputs to this process are:

 * a variable deltaRow specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) how far above to look for a motion vector,

 * a variable deltaCol specifying (in units of 4x4 pixels) how far left to look for a motion vector.

The output of this process is to add a new sample to the list of candidates if it is a valid candidate and has not been seen before.

The variable mvRow is set equal to MiRow + deltaRow.

The variable mvCol is set equal to MiCol + deltaCol.

If is_inside( mvRow, mvCol ) is equal to 0, then this process immediately returns.

If RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 0 ] has not been written for this frame, then this process immediately returns.

If RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 0 ] is not equal to RefFrame[ 0 ], then this process immediately returns.

If RefFrames[ mvRow ][ mvCol ][ 1 ] is not equal to NONE, then this process immediately returns.

The variable candSz  is set equal to MiSizes[ mvRow ][ mvCol ].

The variable candW4 is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ candSz ].

The variable candH4 is set equal to Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ candSz ].

The variable candRow is set equal to mvRow & (candH4 - 1).

The variable candCol is set equal to mvCol & (candW4 - 1).

The variable midY is set equal to candRow * 4 + candH4 * 2 - 1.

The variable midX is set equal to candCol * 4 + candW4 * 2 - 1.

**Note:** candRow and candCol give the top-left position of the candidate block
in units of 4x4 blocks. midX and midY give the central position of the candidate
block in units of pixels.
{:.alert .alert-info }

A candidate array (representing source and destination locations in units of 1/8 pixels, plus a closeness measure) is specified as:

~~~~~ c
cand[ 0 ] = midY * 8
cand[ 1 ] = midX * 8
cand[ 2 ] = midY * 8 + Mvs[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ][ 0 ]
cand[ 3 ] = midY * 8 + Mvs[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ][ 1 ]
cand[ 4 ] = Abs( Mvs[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ][ 0 ] - Mv[ 0 ][ 0 ] ) + 
            Abs( Mvs[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ][ 1 ] - Mv[ 0 ][ 1 ] )
~~~~~

If this array cand is equal (in all 5 locations) to CandList[ i ] for any i < NumSamples, then this process immediately returns.

Otherwise, the following ordered steps apply:

  1. CandList[ NumSamples ][ j ] is set equal to cand[ j ] for j=0..4

  2. NumSamples is increased by 1.
  
**Note:** The test for cand being equal to CandList[i] ensures that each candidate block is only added once to the list.
If the first two entries are equal, all five entries will automatically be equal.
The reference implementation shows how to use additional logic to avoid calling the add sample process more than once per candidate.
{:.alert .alert-info }


##### Sort Sample Process

This process performs a stable sort of NumSamples candidates in CandList in order of how close the motion vectors are to the current blocks motion vector.

The number of active samples is also reduced if the difference between motion vector closenesses is too large.

The sorting process is specified as:

~~~~~ c
for (i = 1; i < NumSamples; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        if (CandList[j][4] > CandList[i][4]) {
            for ( p = 0; p <= 4; p++ )
                temp[p] = CandList[i][p]
            for (k = i; k > j; k--) {
                for ( p = 0; p <= 4; p++ )
                    CandList[k][p] = CandList[k-1][p]
            }
            for ( p = 0; p <= 4; p++ )
                CandList[j][p] = temp[p]
            break
        }
    }
}
ret = NumSamples
for (i = NumSamples - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
    low = (i == 1) ? 1 : Max((CandList[i - 1][4] - CandList[0][4]) / (i - 1), 1)
    if ((CandList[i][4] - CandList[i - 1][4]) >= TRIM_THR * low) ret = i
}
NumSamples = Min( LEAST_SQUARES_SAMPLES_MAX, ret )

### Prediction Processes

The following sections define the processes used for predicting the sample
values.

These processes are triggered at points defined by function calls to
predict_intra, predict_inter, predict_chroma_from_luma, and predict_palette in the residual syntax table described in
[section 5.8.29][].

#### Intra Prediction Process

The intra prediction process is invoked for intra coded blocks to predict a
part of the block corresponding to a transform block. When the transform size
is smaller than the block size, this process can be invoked multiple times
within a single block for the same plane, and the invocations are in raster
order within the block.

The inputs to this process are:

  * the already reconstructed samples in the current frame CurrFrame,

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,

  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the current transform block,

  * a variable haveLeft that is equal to 1 if there are valid samples to the
    left of this transform block,

  * a variable haveAbove that is equal to 1 if there are valid samples above
    this transform block,

  * a variable haveAboveRight that is equal to 1 if there are valid samples above
    the transform block to the right of this transform block,

  * a variable haveBelowLeft that is equal to 1 if there are valid samples to the
    left of the transform block below this transform block,
    
  * a variable mode specifying the type of intra prediction to apply,
    
  * variable log2W specifying the base 2 logarithm of the width of the region to be predicted,
  
  * variable log2H specifying the base 2 logarithm of the height of the region to be predicted.
    
The outputs of this process are intra predicted samples in the current frame
CurrFrame.

    CurrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x - 1 ].
    
  * Otherwise, if haveAbove is equal to 0 and haveLeft is equal to 0, AboveRow[ i ] is set
    equal to ( 1 \<\< ( BitDepth - 1 ) ) - 1.
    
  * Otherwise, the following applies:
  
    * The variable aboveLimit is set equal to Min( maxX, x + ( haveAboveRight ? 2 * w : w ) - 1 ).
    
    * AboveRow[ i ] is set equal to CurrFrame[ plane ][ y-1 ][ Min(aboveLimit, x+i) ].
    
The array LeftCol[ i ] for i = 0..w + h - 1 is derived as follows:

    equal to ( 1 \<\< ( BitDepth - 1 ) ) + 1.
    
  * Otherwise, the following applies:
  
    * The variable leftLimit is set equal to Min( maxY, y + ( haveBelowLeft ? 2 * h : h ) - 1 ).
    
    * LeftCol[ i ] is set equal to CurrFrame[ plane ][ Min(leftLimit, y+i) ][ x-1 ].

    set equal to CurrFrame[ plane ][ y-1 ][ x-1 ].

  * Otherwise if haveAbove is equal to 1, AboveRow[ -1 ] is set equal to
    CurrFrame [ plane ][ y - 1 ][ x ].
  
  * Otherwise if haveLeft is equal to 1, AboveRow[ -1 ] is set equal to
    CurrFrame [ plane ][ y ][ x - 1 ].

  * Otherwise, AboveRow[ -1 ] is set equal to 1 \<\< ( BitDepth - 1 ).

The array LeftCol[ i ] for i = -1 is set equal to AboveRow[ -1 ].

        * The intra filter type process specified in [section 7.7.1.2][] is invoked and the output assigned to filterType.
        
        * If haveAbove is equal to 1, the following steps apply:

              with w, h, filterType, and pAngle - 90 as inputs, and the output assigned to the variable strength.

              maxY - y + 1 ) + 1.

  }
  return aboveSmooth || leftSmooth
}
~~~~~

where the function is_smooth indicates if a prediction mode is one of the smooth intra modes and is specified as:

if (filterType == 0) {
    if (blkWh <= 8) {
        if (d >= 56) strength = 1
    } else if (blkWh <= 12) {

  * a variable h containing the height of the transform in samples,
  
  * a variable filterType that is 0 or 1 that controls the strength of filtering,

} else if ( filterType == 0 ) {
    useUpsample = (blkWh <= 16)
} else {
    useUpsample = (blkWh <= 8)
}
~~~~~

##### Intra Edge Upsample Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable numPx specifying the number of samples to filter,
  
  * a variable dir containing 0 when filtering the above samples, and 1 when filtering the left samples.
  
The output of this process are upsampled samples in the AboveRow and LeftCol arrays.

The variable buf is set depending on dir:

  * If dir is equal to 0, buf is set equal to a reference to AboveRow.
  
  * Otherwise (dir is equal to 1), buf is set equal to a reference to LeftCol.
  
**Note:** buf is a reference to either AboveRow or LeftCol.
"reference" indicates that modifying values in buf modifies values in the original array.
{:.alert .alert-info }

When the process starts, entries -1 to numPx-1 are valid in buf and contain the original values.
When the process completes, entries -2 to 2*numPx-2 are valid in buf and contain the upsampled values.

An array dup of length numPx+3 is generated by extending buf by one sample at the start and end as follows:

~~~~~ c
dup[ 0 ] = buf[ -1 ]
for (i = -1; i < numPx; i++) {
    dup[ i + 1 ] = buf[ i ]
}
dup[ numPx + 2 ] = buf[ numPx - 1 ]
~~~~~

The upsampling process (modifying values in buf) is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
buf[-2] = dup[0]
for (i = 0; i < numPx; i++) {
    s = -dup[i] + (9 * dup[i + 1]) + (9 * dup[i + 2]) - dup[i + 3]
    s = Clip1( Round2(s, 4) )
    buf[ 2 * i - 1 ] = s
    buf[ 2 * i ] = dup[i + 2]
}
~~~~~

##### Intra Edge Filter Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a size sz,
  
  * a filter strength strength between 0 and 3 inclusive,
  
  * an edge direction left (when equal to 1, it specifies a vertical edge; when equal to 0, it specifies
    a horizontal edge.
  
The process filters the LeftCol (if left is equal to 1) or AboveRow (if left is equal to 0) arrays.

If strength is equal to 0, the process returns without doing anything.

Otherwise (strength is not equal to 0), the following ordered steps apply for i = 1..sz-2:

  1. The variable s is set equal to 0.
  
  2. The following steps now apply for j = 0..INTRA_EDGE_TAPS-1.
  
      a. The variable k is set equal to Clip3( 0, sz - 1, i - 2 + j ).
      
      b. The variable s is incremented by Intra_Edge_Kernel[ strength - 1 ][ j ] * ( left ? 
         LeftCol[ k - 1 ] : AboveRow[ k - 1 ] ).
      
  3. If left is equal to 1, LeftCol[ i - 1 ] is set equal to ( s + 8 ) \>\> 4.
  
  4. If left is equal to 0, AboveRow[ i - 1 ] is set equal to ( s + 8 ) \>\> 4.

The array Intra_Edge_Kernel is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
Intra_Edge_Kernel[INTRA_EDGE_KERNELS][INTRA_EDGE_TAPS] = {
  { 0, 4, 8, 4, 0 },
  { 0, 5, 6, 5, 0 },
  { 2, 4, 4, 4, 2 }
}
~~~~~


#### Inter Prediction Process

The inter prediction process is invoked for inter coded blocks and interintra blocks.  The inputs
to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,

  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,

  * variables w and h specifying the width and height of the region to be
    predicted,
    
  * variables candRow and candCol specifying the location (in units of 4x4 blocks) of the motion vector information to be used.
    
The outputs of this process are
predicted samples in the current frame CurrFrame.

This process is triggered by a function call to predict_inter.

The variable isInterInter
is set equal to RefFrames[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 1 ] > INTRA_FRAME.

The variable isCompound is set equal to RefFrames[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 1 ] >= INTRA_FRAME. 

The prediction arrays are formed by
the following ordered steps:

  1. The variable refList is set equal to 0.
  
  2. The variable useWarp is derived as follows:
  
     * If w < 8 or h < 8, useWarp is set equal to 0.
     
     * Otherwise, if force_integer_mv is equal to 1, useWarp is set equal to 0.
    
     * Otherwise, if motion_mode is equal to LOCALWARP, useWarp is set equal to 1.
     
     * Otherwise, if (YMode == GLOBALMV \|\| YMode == GLOBAL_GLOBALMV) and gm_type[ RefFrame[ refList ] ] > TRANSLATION, useWarp is set equal to 1.
    
     * Otherwise, useWarp is set equal to 0.
     
  2. If setting useWarp equal to 1 would result in the bitstream not being conformant
    (due to either the requirement in the warp estimation process in [section 7.7.2.6][] about the determinant being non-zero,
     or the requirement in the setup shear process in [section 7.7.2.4][] about the size of the shear) then useWarp is set equal to 0.
     
  3. If plane is equal to 0 and motion_mode is equal to LOCALWARP and useWarp is equal to 1, the warp estimation process in [section 7.7.2.6][] is invoked.
     
  4. The motion vector array mv is set equal to Mvs[ candRow ][ candCol ][ refList ].
     
  6. The variable refIdx specifying which reference frame is being used is set equal to ref_frame_idx[ RefFrame[ refList ] - LAST_FRAME ].

  7. The motion vector scaling process in [section 7.7.2.1][] is invoked with
     plane, refIdx, x, y, mv as inputs and the output being the
     initial location startX, startY, and the step sizes stepX, stepY.
     
  8. If useWarp is equal to 1, the block warp process in [section 7.7.2.3][] is invoked with
     plane, refList, x, y, i8, j8, w, h as inputs and the
     output is merged into the 2D array preds[ refList ] for i8 = 0..((h-1) \>\> 3) and for j8 = 0..((w-1) \>\> 3).
     (Each invocation fills in a block of output of size w by h at x offset j8 * 8 and y offset i8 * 8.)

  9. If useWarp is equal to 0, the block inter prediction process in [section 7.7.2.2][] is invoked with
     plane, refIdx, startX, startY, stepX, stepY, w, h, candRow, candCol as inputs and the
     output is assigned to the 2D array preds[ refList ].

  10. If isInterInter is equal to 1, then the variable refList is set equal
     to 1 and steps 4 to 9 are repeated to form the prediction for
     the second reference. 
     
If IsInterIntra is equal to 1, the following ordered steps apply:

  1. The variable mode is set as follows:
  
     * If interintra_mode is equal to II_DC_PRED, mode is set equal to DC_PRED.
     
     * Otherwise if interintra_mode is equal to II_V_PRED, mode is set equal to V_PRED,
     
     * Otherwise if interintra_mode is equal to II_H_PRED, mode is set equal to H_PRED,
     
     * Otherwise (interintra_mode is equal to II_SMOOTH_PRED), mode is set equal to SMOOTH_PRED.
     
  2. The variable haveLeft is set equal to AvailL
  
  3. The variable haveAbove is set equal to AvailU
  
  4. The variable haveAboveRight is set equal to 0
  
  5. The variable haveBelowLeft is set equal to 0
  
  6. The variable log2W is set equal to log2( w )
  
  7. The variable log2H is set equal to log2( h )

  8. The intra prediction process specified in [section 7.7.1][] is invoked with plane, x, y, haveLeft, haveAbove, haveAboveRight, haveBelowLeft, mode, log2W, log2H as inputs.  (This will write intra predicted samples into CurrFrame.)
     
An array named Mask is prepared as follows:

  * If compound_type is equal to COMPOUND_WEDGE and plane is equal to 0, the wedge mask process in [section 7.7.2.9][] is invoked with w, h as inputs.
  
  * Otherwise if compound_type is equal to COMPOUND_INTRA, the inter intra mask process in [section 7.7.2.11][] is invoked with preds, plane, x, y, w, h as inputs.
  
  * Otherwise if compound_type is equal to COMPOUND_SEG and plane is equal to 0, the segment mask process in [section 7.7.2.10][] is invoked with preds, w, h as inputs.
  
  * Otherwise, no mask array is needed.
     
The inter predicted samples are then derived as
follows:

  * If isCompound is equal to 0, CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + i ][ x + j ]
   is set equal to Clip1( Round2( preds[ 0 ][ i ][ j ], 9) ) for i = 0..h-1 and j = 0..w-1.

  * Otherwise if compound_type is equal to COMPOUND_AVERAGE, CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + i ][ x + j ] is set equal to
   Clip1( Round2( preds[ 0 ][ i ][ j ] + preds[ 1 ][ i ][ j ], 10 ) )
   for i = 0..h-1 and j = 0..w-1.
   
  * Otherwise, the mask blend process in [section 7.7.2.12][] is invoked with preds, plane, x, y, w, h as inputs.
   
If motion_mode is equal to OBMC, the overlapped motion compensation in [section 7.7.2.7][] is invoked with plane, x, y, w, h as inputs.


##### Motion Vector Scaling Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,
    
  * a variable refIdx specifying which reference frame is being used,

  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,

  * a variable mv specifying the clamped motion vector (in units of 1/8 th of a luma pixel, i.e. with 3 fractional bits).

The outputs of this process are the variables startX and startY giving the
reference block location in units of 1/1024 th of a sample, and variables xStep
and yStep giving the step size in units of 1/1024 th of a sample.

This process is responsible for computing the sampling locations in the
reference frame based on the motion vector. The sampling locations are also
adjusted to compensate for any difference in the size of the reference frame
compared to the current frame.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that all the following conditions
are satisfied:

  * 2 * FrameWidth >= RefFrameWidth[ refIdx ]

  * 2 * FrameHeight >= RefFrameHeight[ refIdx ]

  * FrameWidth <= 16 * RefFrameWidth[ refIdx ]

  * FrameHeight <= 16 * RefFrameHeight[ refIdx ]

A variable xScale is set equal to (RefFrameWidth[ refIdx ] \<\<
REF_SCALE_SHIFT + ( FrameWidth / 2 ) ) / FrameWidth.

A variable yScale is set equal to (RefFrameHeight[ refIdx ] \<\<
REF_SCALE_SHIFT + ( FrameHeight / 2 ) ) / FrameHeight.

(xScale and yScale specify the size of the reference frame relative to the
current frame in units where (1 \<\< 14) is equivalent to both frames having
the same size.)

The variables subX and subY are set equal to the subsampling for the current
plane as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX is set equal to 0 and subY is set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise, subX is set equal to subsampling_x and subY is set equal to
   subsampling_y.
   
The variable halfSample (representing half the size of a sample in units of 1/16 th of a sample) is set equal to ( 1 \<\< ( SUBPEL_BITS - 1 ) ).

The variable origY is set equal to ( (y \<\< SUBPEL_BITS) + ( ( 2 * mv[0] ) \>\> subY ) + halfSample ).

The variable origX is set equal to ( (x \<\< SUBPEL_BITS) + ( ( 2 * mv[1] ) \>\> subX ) + halfSample ).

(origX and origY specify the location of the centre of the sample at the top-left corner of the
reference block in the current frame's coordinate system in units of 1/16 th of a sample, i.e. with SUBPEL_BITS=4 fractional bits.)

The variable baseX is set equal to (x * xScale - ( halfSample \<\< REF_SCALE_SHIFT ) ).

The variable baseY is set equal to (y * yScale - ( halfSample \<\< REF_SCALE_SHIFT ) ).

(baseX and baseY specify the location of the top-left corner of the block in the
reference frame in the reference frame's coordinate system with 18 fractional bits.)

The variable off (containing a rounding offset for the filter tap selection) is set equal to ( ( 1 \<\< (SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS - SUBPEL_BITS) ) / 2 ).

The output variable startX is set equal to (Round2Signed( baseX, REF_SCALE_SHIFT + SUBPEL_BITS - SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS) + off).

The output variable startY is set equal to (Round2Signed( baseY, REF_SCALE_SHIFT + SUBPEL_BITS - SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS) + off).

(startX and startY specify the location of the top-left corner of the block in the
reference frame in the reference frame's coordinate system with SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS=10 fractional bits.)

The output variable stepX is set equal to Round2Signed( xScale, REF_SCALE_SHIFT - SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS).

The output variable stepY is set equal to Round2Signed( yScale, REF_SCALE_SHIFT - SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS).

(stepX and stepY are the size of one current frame sample in the reference frame's coordinate system with 10 fractional bits.)


##### Block Inter Prediction Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane,
  
  * a variable refIdx specifying which reference frame is being used,

  * variables x and y giving the block location with in units of 1/1024 th of a
    sample,

  * variables xStep and yStep giving the step size in units of 1/1024 th of a
    sample,

  * variables w and h giving the width and height of the block in units of
    samples,
    
  * variables candRow and candCol specifying the location (in units of 4x4 blocks) of the motion vector information to be used.

The output from this process is the 2D array named pred containing inter
predicted samples.

A variable ref specifying the reference frame contents is set equal to
FrameStore[ refIdx ].

The variables subX and subY are set equal to the subsampling for the current
plane as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX is set equal to 0 and subY is set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise, subX is set equal to subsampling_x and subY is set equal to
   subsampling_y.

The variable lastX is set equal to ( (RefFrameWidth[ refIdx ] + subX) \>\>
subX) - 1.

The variable lastY is set equal to ( (RefFrameHeight[ refIdx ] + subY) \>\>
subY) - 1.

(lastX and lastY specify the coordinates of the bottom right sample of the reference plane.)

The variable intermediateHeight specifying the height required for the
intermediate array is set equal to (((h - 1) * yStep + (1 \<\< SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS) - 1) \>\> SCALE_SUBPEL_BITS) + 8.

The sub-sample interpolation is effected via two one-dimensional convolutions.
First a horizontal filter is used to build up a temporary array, and then this
array is vertically filtered to obtain the final prediction. The fractional
parts of the motion vectors determine the filtering process. If the fractional
part is zero, then the filtering is equivalent to a straight sample copy.

The filtering is applied as follows:

  * The array intermediate is specified as follows:

    ~~~~~ c
    interpFilter = InterpFilters[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 1 ]
    if ( w <= 4 ) {
        if (interpFilter == EIGHTTAP || interpFilter == EIGHTTAP_SHARP) {
            interpFilter = 4
        } else if (interpFilter == EIGHTTAP_SMOOTH) {
            interpFilter = 5
        }
    }
    for ( r = 0; r < intermediateHeight; r++ ) {
        for ( c = 0; c < w; c++ ) {
            s = 0
            p = x + xStep * c
            for ( t = 0; t < 8; t++ )
                s += Subpel_Filters[ interpFilter ][ (p >> 6) & 15 ][ t ] *
                  ref[ plane ] [ Clip3( 0, lastY, (y >> 10) + r - 3 ) ]
                               [ Clip3( 0, lastX, (p >> 10) + t - 3 ) ]
            intermediate[ r ][ c ] = Round2(s, 5)
        }
    }

        if (interpFilter == EIGHTTAP || interpFilter == EIGHTTAP_SHARP) {

        } else if (interpFilter == EIGHTTAP_SMOOTH) {
            interpFilter = 5
        }
    }
    for ( r = 0; r < h; r++ ) {
        for ( c = 0; c < w; c++ ) {
            s = 0
            p = (y & 1023) + yStep * r
            for ( t = 0; t < 8; t++ )
                s += Subpel_Filters[ interpFilter ][ (p >> 6) & 15 ][ t ] *
                  intermediate[ (p >> 10) + t ][ c ]

##### Block Warp Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane,

  * a variable refList specifying that we should predict from
    RefFrame[ refList ],
    
  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,
    
  * variables i8 and j8 specifying the offset (in units of 8 samples) relative to the top left sample,

  * variables w and h giving the width and height of the block in units of
    samples.

The output from this process is the 2D array named pred containing warped inter
predicted samples.

The process only updates a section of the pred array.  The size of the updated section is 8x8 samples, clipped to the size of the block.
Variables i8 and j8 give the location of the section to update.

A variable refIdx specifying which reference frame is being used is set equal
to ref_frame_idx[ RefFrame[ refList ] - LAST_FRAME ].

A variable ref specifying the reference frame contents is set equal to
FrameStore[ refIdx ].

The variables subX and subY are set equal to the subsampling for the current
plane as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX is set equal to 0 and subY is set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise, subX is set equal to subsampling_x and subY is set equal to
   subsampling_y.

The variable lastX is set equal to ( (RefFrameWidth[ refIdx ] + subX) \>\>
subX) - 1.

The variable lastY is set equal to ( (RefFrameHeight[ refIdx ] + subY) \>\>
subY) - 1.

(lastX and lastY specify the coordinates of the bottom right sample of the reference plane.)

The variable srcX is set equal to (j8 * 8 + 4) \<\< subX.

The variable srcY is set equal to (i8 * 8 + 4) \<\< subY.

(srcX and srcY specify a location in the luma plane that will be projected using the warp parameters.)

The array warpParams is specified as follows:

  * If motion_mode is equal to LOCALWARP, warpParams is set equal to LocalWarpParams.

  * Otherwise (motion_mode is not equal to LOCALWARP), warpParams is set equal to gm_params[ RefFrame[ refList ] ].

The variable dstX is set equal to warpParams[2] * srcX + warpParams[3] * srcY + warpParams[0].

The variable dstY is set equal to warpParams[4] * srcX + warpParams[5] * srcY + warpParams[1].

(dstX and dstY specify the destination location in the luma plane using WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS bits of precision).

The setup shear process specified in [section 7.7.2.4][] is invoked with warpParams as input, and the outputs are assigned to alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

The sub-sample interpolation is effected via two one-dimensional convolutions.
First a horizontal filter is used to build up a temporary array, and then this
array is vertically filtered to obtain the final prediction.

The filtering is applied as follows:

  * The array intermediate is specified as follows:

    ~~~~~ c

    y4 = dstY >> subY
    ix4 = x4 >> WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS

                  ref[ plane ][ Clip3( 0, lastY, iy4 + k ) ]
                              [ Clip3( 0, lastX, ix4 + l - 3 + m ) ]
            }

        }
    }

  * The array pred is specified as follows:

    ~~~~~ c 
    for (k = -4; k < Min(4, h - i8 * 8 - 4); k++) {

            offs = Round2(sy, WARPEDDIFF_PREC_BITS) + WARPEDPIXEL_PREC_SHIFTS
            s = 0
            for (m = 0; m < 8; m++) {
                s += Warped_Filters[offs][m] * 
                     intermediate[(k + m + 4)][(l + 4)]
            }

##### Setup Shear Process

The input for this process is an array warpParams representing an affine transformation.

The outputs from this process are variables alpha, beta, gamma, delta representing two shearing operations that combine to make the full affine transformation.

The variable alpha0 is set equal to Clip3( -32768, 32767, warpParams[ 2 ] - (1 \<\< WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS) ).

The variable beta0 is set equal to Clip3( -32768, 32767, warpParams[ 3 ] ).

The resolve divisor process specified in [section 7.7.2.5][] is invoked with warpParams[ 2 ] as input, and the outputs assigned to divShift and divFactor.

The variable v is set equal to ( warpParams[ 4 ] \<\< WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS ).

The variable gamma0 is set equal to Clip3( -32768, 32767, Round2Signed( v * divFactor, divShift ) ).

The variable w is set equal to ( warpParams[ 3 ] * warpParams[ 4 ] ).

The variable delta0 is set equal to Clip3( -32768, 32767, warpParams[ 5 ] - Round2Signed( w * divFactor, divShift ) - (1 \<\< WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS) ).

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that 4 * Abs( alpha0 ) + 7 * Abs( beta0 ) is less than (1 \<\< WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS).

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that 4 * Abs( gamma0 ) + 4 * Abs( delta0 ) is less than (1 \<\< WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS).

The output variables are set as follows:

~~~~~ c
alpha = Round2Signed( alpha0, WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS ) << WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS
beta = Round2Signed( beta0, WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS ) << WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS
gamma = Round2Signed( gamma0, WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS ) << WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS
delta = Round2Signed( delta0, WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS ) << WARP_PARAM_REDUCE_BITS
~~~~~

##### Resolve Divisor Process

The input for this process is a variable d.

The outputs for this process are variables divShift and divFactor that can be used to perform an approximate division by d via multiplying by divFactor and shifting right by divShift.

The variable n (representing the location of the most signficant bit in Abs(d) ) is set equal to floor( log2( Abs(d) ) ).

The variable e is set equal to Abs( d ) - ( 1 \<\< n ).

The variable f is set as follows:

  * If n > DIV_LUT_BITS, f is set equal to Round2( e, n - DIV_LUT_BITS ).
  
  * Otherwise, f is set equal to e \<\< ( DIV_LUT_BITS - n ).
  
The output variable divShift is set equal to ( n + DIV_LUT_PREC_BITS ).

The output variable divFactor is set as follows:

  * If d is less than 0, divFactor is set equal to -Div_Lut[ f ].
  
  * Otherwise, divFactor is set equal to Div_Lut[ f ].

The lookup table Div_Lut is specified as:

~~~~~ c
Div_Lut[DIV_LUT_NUM] = {

##### Warp Estimation Process

This process produces the array LocalWarpParams based on NumSamples candidates in CandList by performing a least squares fit.

A 2x2 matrix A, and two length 2 arrays Bx and By are constructed as follows:

~~~~~ c
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        A[i][j] = 0
    }
    Bx[i] = 0
    By[i] = 0
}
w4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[MiSize]
h4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_High[MiSize]
midY = MiRow * 4 + h4 * 2 - 1
midX = MiCol * 4 + w4 * 2 - 1
suy = midY * 8
sux = midX * 8
duy = suy + Mv[0][0]
dux = sux + Mv[0][1]
n = 0
for (i = 0; i < NumSamples; i++) {
    sy = CandList[i][0] - suy + 1
    sx = CandList[i][1] - sux + 1
    dy = CandList[i][2] - duy + 1
    dx = CandList[i][3] - dux + 1
    if (Abs(sx - dx) < LS_MV_MAX && Abs(sy - dy) < LS_MV_MAX) {
        A[0][0] += sx * sx + 1
        A[0][1] += sx * sy
        A[1][1] += sy * sy + 1
        Bx[0] += sx * dx + 1
        Bx[1] += sy * dx
        By[0] += sx * dy
        By[1] += sy * dy + 1
        n += 1
    }
}
if (n >= 4)
    downshift = LS_MAT_DOWN_BITS
else if (n >= 2)
    downshift = LS_MAT_DOWN_BITS - 1
else
    downshift = LS_MAT_DOWN_BITS - 2
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        A[i][j] = Clip3(LS_MAT_MIN, LS_MAT_MAX, Round2Signed(A[i][j], downshift))
    }
    Bx[i] = Clip3(LS_MAT_MIN, LS_MAT_MAX, Round2Signed(Bx[i], downshift))
    By[i] = Clip3(LS_MAT_MIN, LS_MAT_MAX, Round2Signed(By[i], downshift))
}
~~~~~

**Note:** The matrix A is symmetric so entry A[1][0] is omitted.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**Note:** The addition of 1 in certain places in this code has the effect of
treating each candidate as providing four closely samples. This helps to
regularize the solution.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The variable det (containing the determinant of the matrix A) is set equal to A[0][0] * A[1][1] - A[0][1] * A[0][1].

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that det is not equal to 0.

The resolve divisor process specified in [section 7.7.2.5][] is invoked with det as input, and the outputs assigned to divShift and divFactor.

The local warp parameters in LocalWarpParams are derived as follows:

~~~~~ c
    divShift -= WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS
    if (divShift < 0) {
        divFactor = divFactor << (-divShift)
        divShift = 0
    }
    LocalWarpParams[2] = diag(     A[1][1] * Bx[0] - A[0][1] * Bx[1])
    LocalWarpParams[3] = nondiag( -A[0][1] * Bx[0] + A[0][0] * Bx[1])
    LocalWarpParams[4] = nondiag(  A[1][1] * By[0] - A[0][1] * By[1])
    LocalWarpParams[5] = diag(    -A[0][1] * By[0] + A[0][0] * By[1])

    mvx = Mv[ 0 ][ 1 ]
    mvy = Mv[ 0 ][ 0 ]
    vx = mvx * (1 << (WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 3)) -
         (midX * (LocalWarpParams[2] - (1 << WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS)) + midY * LocalWarpParams[3])
    vy = mvy * (1 << (WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS - 3)) -
         (midX * LocalWarpParams[4] + midY * (LocalWarpParams[5] - (1 << WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS)))
    LocalWarpParams[0] = Clip3(-WARPEDMODEL_TRANS_CLAMP, WARPEDMODEL_TRANS_CLAMP - 1, vx)
    LocalWarpParams[1] = Clip3(-WARPEDMODEL_TRANS_CLAMP, WARPEDMODEL_TRANS_CLAMP - 1, vy)
~~~~~

where diag and nondiag are specified to divide and clamp using divFactor and divShift as follows:

~~~~~ c
nondiag(v) {
    return Clip3(-WARPEDMODEL_NONDIAGAFFINE_CLAMP + 1,
                  WARPEDMODEL_NONDIAGAFFINE_CLAMP - 1,
                  Round2Signed(v * divFactor, divShift))
}

diag(v) {
    return Clip3((1 << WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS) - WARPEDMODEL_NONDIAGAFFINE_CLAMP + 1,
                 (1 << WARPEDMODEL_PREC_BITS) + WARPEDMODEL_NONDIAGAFFINE_CLAMP - 1,
                 Round2Signed(v * divFactor, divShift))
}
~~~~~

##### Overlapped Motion Compensation Process

The inputs
to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,

  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,

  * variables w and h specifying the width and height of the region to be
    predicted.
    
The outputs of this process are modified inter
predicted samples in the current frame CurrFrame.

This process blends the inter predicted samples for the current block with inter predicted samples
based on motion vectors from the above and left blocks.

The maximum number of overlapped predictions is limited based on the size of the block.

For small blocks, only the left neighbour will be used to form the prediction.

The variables subX and subY describing the subsampling of the current plane
are derived as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX and subY are set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise (plane is not equal to 0), subX is set equal to subsampling_x
    and subY is set equal to subsampling_y.

The process is specified as:

~~~~~ c
if ( AvailU ) {
    if ( get_plane_residual_size( MiSize, plane ) >= BLOCK_8X8 ) {
        pass = 0
        w4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ MiSize ]
        x4 = MiCol
        y4 = MiRow
        nCount = 0
        nLimit = Min(4, Mi_Width_Log2[ MiSize ])
        while ( nCount < nLimit && x4 < Min( MiCols, MiCol + w4 ) ) {
            candRow = MiRow - 1
            candCol = x4 | 1
            candSz = MiSizes[ candRow ][ candCol ]
            step4 = Max(2, Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ candSz ])
            if ( RefFrames[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ] > INTRA_FRAME ) {
                nCount += 1
                predW = Min( w, ( step4 * MI_SIZE ) >> subX )
                predH = Min( h >> 1, 32 >> subY )
                mask = get_obmc_mask( predH )
                predict_overlap( )
            }
            x4 += step4
        }
    }
}
if ( AvailL ) {
    pass = 1
    h4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ MiSize ]
    x4 = MiCol
    y4 = MiRow
    nCount = 0
    nLimit = Min(4, Mi_Height_Log2[ MiSize ])
    while ( nCount < nLimit && y4 < Min( MiRows, MiRow + h4 ) ) {
        candCol = MiCol - 1
        candRow = y4 | 1
        candSz = MiSizes[ candRow ][ candCol ]
        step4 = Max(2, Num_4x4_Blocks_High[ candSz ])
        if ( RefFrames[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ] > INTRA_FRAME ) {
            nCount += 1
            predW = Min( w >> 1, 32 >> subX )
            predH = Min( h, ( step4 * MI_SIZE ) >> subY )
            mask = get_obmc_mask( predW )
            predict_overlap( )
        }
        y4 += step4
    }
}
~~~~~

When the function predict_overlap is invoked, the following ordered steps apply to form the overlap prediction for a region of size predW by predH based on the candidate motion vector:

  1. The motion vector mv is set equal to Mvs[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ].
  
  2. The variable refIdx is set equal to ref_frame_idx[ RefFrames[ candRow ][ candCol ][ 0 ] - LAST_FRAME ].
  
  3. The variable predX is set equal to (x4 * 4) \>\> subX.
  
  4. The variable predY is set equal to (y4 * 4) \>\> subY.

  5. The motion vector scaling process in [section 7.7.2.1][] is invoked with
     plane, refIdx, predX, predY, mv as inputs and the output being the
     initial location startX, startY, and the step sizes stepX, stepY.

  6. The block inter prediction process in [section 7.7.2.2][] is invoked with
     plane, refIdx, startX, startY, stepX, stepY, predW, predH, candRow, candCol as inputs and the
     output is assigned to the 2D array obmcPred.
     
  7. obmcPred[ i ][ j ] is set equal to Clip1( Round2( obmcPred[ i ][ j ], 9) ) for i = 0..predH-1 and j = 0..predW-1.
  
  8. The blending process in [section 7.7.2.8][] is invoked with plane, predX, predY, predW, predH, pass, obmcPred, and mask as inputs.
  
The function get_obmc_mask returns a blending mask as follows:

~~~~~ c
get_obmc_mask( length ) {
    if (length == 1) {
        return Obmc_Mask_1
    } else if (length == 2) {
        return Obmc_Mask_2
    } else if (length == 4) {
        return Obmc_Mask_4
    } else if (length == 8) {
        return Obmc_Mask_8
    } else if (length == 16) {
        return Obmc_Mask_16
    } else if (length == 32) {
        return Obmc_Mask_32
    }
}
~~~~~

The blending masks are defined as follows:

~~~~~ c
Obmc_Mask_1[1] = { 64 }

Obmc_Mask_2[2] = { 45, 64 }

Obmc_Mask_4[4] = { 39, 50, 59, 64 }

Obmc_Mask_8[8] = { 36, 42, 48, 53, 57, 61, 64, 64 }

Obmc_Mask_16[16] = { 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 54,
                     56, 58, 60, 61, 64, 64, 64, 64 }

Obmc_Mask_32[32] = { 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44,
                     45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55,
                     56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60, 61, 62,
                     64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64 }
~~~~~

##### Overlap Blending Process

The inputs
to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,

  * variables predX and predY specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,

  * variables predW and predH specifying the width and height of the region to be
    predicted,
    
  * a variable pass equal to 0 if blending above samples, or equal to 1 if blending left samples,
  
  * a 2d array obmcPred containing the samples predicted from a neighbouring motion vector,
  
  * an array mask containing the blending weights.
    
The outputs of this process are modified inter
predicted samples in the current frame CurrFrame.

For i = 0..(predH - 1) and j = 0..(predW - 1), the following ordered steps apply:

  1. The variable m specifying the blending factor is specifed as follows:

     * If pass is equal to 0 (blend from above), m is set equal to mask[ i ].
    
     * Otherwise (pass is equal to 0 meaning blend from left), m is set equal to mask[ j ].

  2. CurrFrame[ plane ][ predY + i ][ predX + j ] is set equal to
    Round2( m * CurrFrame[ plane ][ predY + i ][ predX + j ] + (64 - m) * obmcPred[ i ][ j ], 6)
    
##### Wedge Mask Process

The input to this process is:

* variables w and h specifying the width and height of the region to be
    predicted.

This process sets up a mask array for the luma samples.

The mask is specified as:

~~~~~ c
for (i = 0; i < h; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        Mask[ i ][ j ] = WedgeMasks[ MiSize ][ wedge_sign ][ wedge_index ][ i ][ j ]

##### Segment Mask Process

The input to this process is:
 
  * an array preds containing the predicted samples,
  
  * variables w and h specifying the width and height of the region to be
  predicted.

This process prepares an array Mask containing the blending weights for the luma samples.

The process sets the array based on the difference between the two predictions as follows:

~~~~~ c
for (i = 0; i < h; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        diff = Abs(preds[ 0 ][ i ][ j ] - preds[ 1 ][ i ][ j ])
        diff = Round2(diff, (BitDepth - 8) + 9)
        m = Clip3(0, 64, 38 + diff / 16)
        if (mask_type)
            Mask[ i ][ j ] = 64 - m
        else
            Mask[ i ][ j ] = m

    }
}
~~~~~

##### Inter Intra Mask Process

The input to this process is:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,
  
  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,

  * variables w and h specifying the width and height of the region to be
    predicted.

This process prepares an array Mask containing the blending weights for the luma samples.

The process sets the array based on the mode used for intra prediction as follows:

~~~~~ c
sizeScale = MAX_SB_SIZE / Max( h, w )
for (i = 0; i < h; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < w; j++) {
        if (interintra_mode == II_V_PRED) {
            Mask[ i ][ j ] = Ii_Weights_1d[ i * sizeScale ]
        } else if (interintra_mode == II_H_PRED) {
            Mask[ i ][ j ] = Ii_Weights_1d[ j * sizeScale ]
        } else if (interintra_mode == II_SMOOTH_PRED) {
            Mask[ i ][ j ] = Ii_Weights_1d[ Min(i, j) * sizeScale ]
        } else {
            Mask[ i ][ j ] = 32
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

where the table Ii_Weights_1d is defined as:

~~~~~ c
Ii_Weights_1d[MAX_SB_SIZE] = {
  60, 58, 56, 54, 52, 50, 48, 47, 45, 44, 42, 41, 39, 38, 37, 35, 34, 33, 32,

}
~~~~~


##### Mask Blend Process

The inputs to this process are

  * an array preds containing the predicted samples,
  
  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,

  * variables dstX and dstY specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the region to be predicted,

  * variables w and h specifying the width and height of the region to be
    predicted.
    
The process combines two predictions according to the mask.  
It makes use of an array Mask containing the blending weights to apply (the weights are defined for the current plane samples if compound_type is equal to COMPOUND_INTRA, or the luma plane otherwise).

The variables subX and subY describing the subsampling of the current plane
are derived as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX and subY are set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise (plane is not equal to 0), subX is set equal to subsampling_x
    and subY is set equal to subsampling_y.
    
The process is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
for (y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    for (x = 0; x < w; x++) {
        if (!subX && !subY) {
            m = Mask[ y ][ x ]
        } else if (subX && !subY) {
            m = Round2(Mask[ y ][ 2*x ] + Mask[ y ][ 2*x+1 ], 1)
        } else if (!subX && subY) {
            m = Round2(Mask[ 2*y ][ x ] + Mask[ 2*y+1 ][ x ], 1)
        } else {
            m = Round2(Mask[ 2*y ][ 2*x ] + Mask[ 2*y ][ 2*x+1 ] +
                       Mask[ 2*y+1 ][ 2*x ] + Mask[ 2*y+1 ][ 2*x+1 ], 2)
        }
        if (interintra) {
            pred0 = Clip1(Round2(preds[ 0 ][ y ][ x ], 9))
            pred1 = CurrFrame[plane][x+dstX][y+dstY]
            CurrFrame[plane][x+dstX][y+dstY] = Round2( m * pred1 + (64 - m) * pred0, 6 )
        } else {
            pred0 = preds[ 0 ][ y ][ x ]
            pred1 = preds[ 1 ][ y ][ x ]
            CurrFrame[plane][x+dstX][y+dstY] = Clip1( Round2( Round2(m * pred0 + (64 - m) * pred1, 6), 9 ) )
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

#### Palette Prediction Process

The palette prediction process is invoked for palette coded intra blocks to predict
a part of the block using the limited palette.

The inputs to this process are:

- a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,
- variables startX and startY specifying the location of the top left
  sample in the CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the current transform block,
- variables x and y specifying the location in 4x4 units relative to the
  top left sample of the current transform block,
- a variable txSz, specifying the size of the current transform block.

The outputs of this process are palette predicted samples in the current
frame CurrFrame.

The variable w specifying the width of the transform block is set equal
to Tx_Width[ txSz ].

The variable h specifying the height of the transform block is set equal
to Tx_Height[ txSz ].

The variable palette is specified as follows:

- If plane is 0, palette is set to palette_colors_y.
- Otherwise, if plane is 1, palette is set to palette_colors_u.
- Otherwise (plane is 2), palette is set to palette_colors_v.

The variable map is specified as follows:

- If plane is 0, map is set to ColorMapY.
- Otherwise (plane is not 0), map is set to ColorMapUV.

The current frame is updated as follows:

- CurrFrame[ plane ][ startY + i ][ startX + j ] is set equal to palette[ map[ y * 4 + i ][ x * 4 + j ] ] for
i = 0..h-1 and j = 0..w-1.

#### Predict Chroma From Luma Process

The chroma from luma process uses luma predicted samples to form a prediction for the chroma samples.
The high frequencies are taken from the luma prediction and combined with DC predicted chroma samples.

The inputs to this process are:

- a variable plane (greater than zero) specifying which plane is being predicted,

- variables startX and startY specifying the location of the top left
  sample in the CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the current transform block,
  
- a variable txSz, specifying the size of the current transform block.

The outputs of this process are modified chroma predicted samples in the current
frame CurrFrame.

The variable w specifying the width of the transform block is set equal
to Tx_Width[ txSz ].

The variable h specifying the height of the transform block is set equal
to Tx_Height[ txSz ].

The variable subX is set equal to subsampling_x.

The variable subY is set equal to subsampling_y.

The variable alpha depends on the plane as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 1, alpha is set equal to CflAlphaU.
  
  * Otherwise (plane is equal to 2), alpha is set equal to CflAlphaV.

An array L (containing subsampled luma pixels with 3 fractional bits of precision) and lumaAvg (representing the average luma intensity with 3 fractional bits of precision) is specified as:

~~~~~ c
lumaAvg = 0
for ( i = 0; i < h; i++ ) {
    for ( j = 0; j < w; j++ ) {
        lumaX = (startX + j) << subX  
        lumaY = (startY + i) << subY
        t = 0
        for ( dy = 0; dy <= subY; dy += 1 ) 
            for ( dx = 0; dx <= subY; dx += 1 ) 
                t += CurrFrame[ 0 ][ Min( MaxLumaH - 1, lumaY + dy ) ]
                                   [ Min( MaxLumaW - 1, lumaX + dx ) ]
        v = t << ( 3 - subX - subY )
        L[ i ][ j ] = v
        lumaAvg += v
    }
}
lumaAvg >>= Tx_Width_Log2[ txSz ] + Tx_Height_Log2[ txSz ]
~~~~~

The predicted chroma pixels are specified as:

~~~~~ c
for ( i = 0; i < h; i++ ) {
    for ( j = 0; j < w; j++ ) {
        dc = CurrFrame[ plane ][ startY + i ][ startX + j ]
        scaledLuma = Round2Signed( alpha * ( L[ i ][ j ] - lumaAvg ), 6 )
        CurrFrame[ plane ][ startY + i ][ startX + j ] = Clip1( dc + scaledLuma )
    }
}

The function get_qindex( ignoreDeltaQ, segmentId ) returns the quantizer index for the current block and is specified by the following:

  * If seg_feature_active( SEG_LVL_ALT_Q ) is equal to 1 the following ordered steps apply:

    1. Set the variable data equal to FeatureData[ segmentId ][ SEG_LVL_ALT_Q ].

    2. Set data equal to base_q_idx + data

    3. Return Clip3( 0, 255, data ).

  * Otherwise, if ignoreDeltaQ is equal to 0 and delta_q_present is equal to 1, return CurrentQIndex.

  * Otherwise, return base_q_idx.

The function get_dc_quant( plane ) returns the quantizer value for the dc
coefficient for a particular plane and is derived as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, return dc_q( get_qindex( 0, segment_id ) + deltaQYDc ).

  * Otherwise, return dc_q( get_qindex( 0, segment_id ) + deltaQUVDc ).

coefficient for a particular plane and is derived as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, return ac_q( get_qindex( 0, segment_id ) ).

  * Otherwise, return ac_q( get_qindex( 0, segment_id ) + deltaQUVAc ).


#### Reconstruct Process

The reconstruct process is invoked to perform dequantization, inverse
transform and reconstruction. This process is triggered at a point defined by
a function call to reconstruct in the residual syntax table described in
[section 5.8.29][].

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being reconstructed,

  * variables x and y specifying the location of the top left sample in the
    CurrFrame[ plane ] array of the current transform block,

  * a variable txSz, specifying the size of the transform block.

The outputs of this process are reconstructed samples in the current frame
CurrFrame.

The reconstruction and dequantization process is defined as follows:

The variable transpose is set equal to ( Tx_Width_Log2[ txSz ] - Tx_Height_Log2[ txSz ] ) == 1.

The variable txSize is derived as follows:

  * If transpose is equal to 1, txSize is set equal to Transpose_Tx_Size[ txSz ].
  
  * Otherwise (transpose is equal to 0), txSize is set equal to txSz.
  
The variable txType is derived as follows:

  * If transpose is equal to 1, txType is set equal to Transpose_Tx_Type[ PlaneTxType ].
  
  * Otherwise (transpose is equal to 0), txType is set equal to PlaneTxType.

The variable dqDenom is derived as follows:

  * If txSize is equal to TX_32X32, TX_16X32, or TX_32X16, dqDenom is set equal to 2.
  
  * Otherwise, if txSize is equal to TX_64X64, TX_32X64, or TX_64X32, dqDenom is set equal to 4.
  
  * Otherwise, dqDenom is set equal to 1.

The variable log2W (specifying the base 2 logarithm of the width of the transform
block) is set equal to Tx_Width_Log2[ txSize ].

The variable log2H (specifying the base 2 logarithm of the height of the transform
block) is set equal to Tx_Height_Log2[ txSize ].

The variable w (specifying the width of the transform block) is set equal
to 1 \<\< log2W.

The variable h (specifying the height of the transform block) is set equal
to 1 \<\< log2H.

The variable is2To1Rect is set equal to Abs( log2H - log2W ) == 1.

The variable flipUD is derived as follows. If txType is equal to one of FLIPADST_DCT, 
FLIPADST_ADST, V_FLIPADST, or FLIPADST_FLIPADST, flipUD is set equal to 1. Otherwise, 
flipUD is set equal to 0.

The variable flipLR is derived as follows. If txType is equal to one of DCT_FLIPADST, 
ADST_FLIPADST, H_FLIPADST, or FLIPADST_FLIPADST, flipLR is set equal to 1. Otherwise, 
flipLR is set equal to 0.

The following ordered steps apply:

  1. For i = 0..(h-1), for j = 0..(w-1), the following ordered steps apply:
  
      a. The variable q is derived as follows:
        
        * If i is equal to 0 and j is equal to 0, the variable q is set equal to get_dc_quant( plane ).
      
        * Otherwise (i, j or both are not equal to 0), the variable q is set equal to get_ac_quant( plane ).
      
      b. The variable q2 is derived as follows:
      
        * If using_qmatrix is equal to 1, txType is less than IDTX, and SegQMLevel[ segment_id ] is less than 15, q2 is set
         equal to Round2( q * Quantizer_Matrix[ SegQMLevel[ segment_id ] ][ plane > 0 ][ Qm_Offset[ txSize ] + i * w + j ], 4 ).
         
        * Otherwise, q2 is set equal to q.
      
      c. Dequant[ i ][ j ] is set equal to ( Quant[ i * w + j ] *
         q2 ) / dqDenom.

  2. Invoke the 2D inverse transform block process defined in [section 7.9.2][]
     with the variables txSize, txType and transpose as input. The inverse transform outputs are stored
     back to the Dequant buffer.

  3. For i = 0..(h-1), for j = 0..(w-1), the following applies:
  
      * The variable xx is set equal to flipLR ? ( w - j - 1 ) : j.
        
      * The variable yy is set equal to flipUD ? ( h - i - 1 ) : i.
      
      * If transpose is equal to 1, the values of the variables xx and yy are swapped.
      
      * CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + yy ][ x + xx ] is set equal to
        Clip1( CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + yy ][ x + xx ] + Dequant[ i ][ j ] ).

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the values written into the
Dequant array in steps 1 and 2 are representable by a signed integer with 8 +
BitDepth bits.


### Inverse Transform Process

This section details the inverse transforms used during the reconstruction
processes detailed in [section 7.8][].


#### 1D Transforms

##### Butterfly Functions

This section defines the butterfly functions B, H, SB, SH used by the 1D
transform processes.

The inverse transform process works by writing values into an array T. It is a
requirement of bitstream conformance that the values saved into the array T
are representable by a signed integer using 8 + BitDepth bits of precision.

**Note:** The inverse asymmetric discrete sine transforms also make use of an
intermediate array named S. The values in this array require higher precision
to avoid overflow. Using signed integers with 24 + BitDepth bits of precision
is enough to avoid overflow.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The function brev(numBits, x) returns the bit-reversal of numBits of x and is
specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
brev( numBits, x ) {
    t = 0
    for ( i = 0; i < numBits; i++ ) {
        bit = (x >> i) & 1
        t += bit << (numBits - 1 - i)
    }
    return t
}
~~~~~

The function B( a, b, angle, highPrecision, 0 ) performs a butterfly rotation specified by
the following ordered steps:

  1. The variable x is set equal to T[ a ] * cos128( highPrecision, angle ) - T[ b ] *
     sin128( highPrecision, angle ).

  2. The variable y is set equal to T[ a ] * sin128( highPrecision, angle ) + T[ b ] *
     cos128( highPrecision, angle ).

  3. T[ a ] is set equal to Round2( x, highPrecision ? 13 : 12 ).

  4. T[ b ] is set equal to Round2( y, highPrecision ? 13 : 12 ).

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the values saved into the
array T by this function are representable by a signed integer using 8 +
BitDepth bits of precision.

The function cos128( highPrecision, angle ) is specified for integer values of the input angle
by the following ordered steps:

  1. Set a variable angle2 equal to angle & 255.

  2. If angle2 is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 64,
     return Cos128_Lookup[ highPrecision ][ angle2 ].

  3. If angle2 is greater than 64 and less than or equal to 128, return
     Cos128_Lookup[ highPrecision ][ 128 - angle2 ] * -1.

  4. If angle2 is greater than 128 and less than or equal to 192, return
     Cos128_Lookup[ highPrecision ][ angle2 - 128 ] * -1.

  5. Otherwise (if angle2 is greater than 192 and less than 256), return
     Cos128_Lookup[ highPrecision ][ 256 - angle2 ].

Where Cos128_Lookup is a constant lookup table defined as:

~~~~~ c
Cos128_Lookup[ 2 ][ 65 ] = {

The function sin128( highPrecision, angle ) is defined to be cos128( highPrecision, angle - 64 ).

**Note:** The cos128 function implements the expression round( ( highPrecision ?
8192 : 4096 ) * cos( angle * pi / 128 ) ). The sin128 function implements the expression
round( ( highPrecision ? 8192 : 4096 ) * sin( angle * pi / 128 ) ).
{:.alert .alert-info }

When the angle is equal to 32 + 64 * k for integer k the butterfly rotation can
be equivalently performed with two fewer multiplications (because the
magnitude of cos128(highPrecision, 32 + 64 * k) is always equal to that of sin128(highPrecision, 32 + 64 * k))
by the following process:

  1. The variable v is set equal to (angle & 64) ? T[ a ] +
     T[ b ] : T[ a ] - T[ b ].

  2. The variable w is set equal to (angle & 64) ? -T[ a ] +
     T[ b ] : T[ a ] + T[ b ].

  3. The variable x is set equal to v * cos128( highPrecision, angle ).

  4. The variable y is set equal to w * cos128( highPrecision, angle ).

  5. T[ a ] is set equal to Round2( x, highPrecision ? 13 : 12 ).

  6. T[ b ] is set equal to Round2( y, highPrecision ? 13 : 12 ).

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the angle is equal to 16 +
32 * k for integer k, the variables v and w are representable by a signed
integer using 8 + BitDepth bits of precision.

The function B( a ,b, angle, highPrecision, 1 ) performs a butterfly rotation and flip
specified by the following ordered steps:

  1. The function B( a, b, angle, 0 ) is invoked.

  2. The contents of T[ a ] and T[ b ] are exchanged.

The function H( a, b, 0 ) performs a Hadamard rotation specified by the
following ordered steps:

  1. The variable x is set equal to T[ a ].

  2. The variable y is set equal to T[ b ].

  3. T[ a ] is set equal to x + y.

  4. T[ b ] is set equal to x - y.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the values saved into the
array T by this function are representable by a signed integer using 8 +
BitDepth bits of precision.

The function H( a, b, 1 ) performs a Hadamard rotation with flipped indices
and is specified as follows:

  1. The function H( b, a, 0 ) is invoked.

### Loop Filter Process

Input to this process is the array CurrFrame of reconstructed samples.

Output from this process is a modified array CurrFrame containing deblocked
samples.

The purpose of the loop filter is to eliminate (or at least reduce) visually
objectionable artifacts associated with the semi-independence of the coding of
super blocks and their constituent sub-blocks.

The loop filter is applied on all vertical boundaries followed by all horizontal boundaries as
follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( plane = 0; plane < 3; plane++ ) {
    if ( ( plane == 0 && ( loop_filter_level[ 0 ] || loop_filter_level[ 1 ] ) ) ||
         ( plane > 0 && loop_filter_level[ 1 + plane ] ) ) {
        for ( pass = 0; pass < 2; pass++ ) {
            rowStep = ( plane > 0 ) ? 1 : ( 1 << subsampling_y )
            colStep = ( plane > 0 ) ? 1 : ( 1 << subsampling_x )
            for ( row = 0; row < MiRows; row += rowStep )
                for ( col = 0; col < MiCols; col += colStep )
                    loop_filter_edge( plane, pass, row, col )
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

When the function loop_filter_edge is called, the edge loop filter process specified
in [section 7.10.1][] is invoked with the variables plane, pass, row, and col as inputs.

**Note:** The loop filter is an integral part of the decoding process, in that
the results of loop filtering are used in the prediction of subsequent frames.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**Note:** The loop filtering is designed so that any order of filtering for the edges
will give identical results, provided that the vertical boundaries are filtered before
the horizontal boundaries.
{:.alert .alert-info }

**Note:** The loop filter applies after the macroblocks have been
"reconstructed" (i.e., had their prediction summed with their residual);
correct decoding is predicated on the fact that already-constructed portions
of the current frame referenced via intra prediction are not yet filtered.
{:.alert .alert-info }


#### Edge Loop Filter Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U, or V samples,

  * a variable pass specifying the direction of the edges. pass equal to 0
    means we are filtering vertical block boundaries, and pass equal to 1
    means we are filtering horizontal block boundaries,

  * variables row and col specifying the location of the edge in units
    of 4x4 blocks in the luma plane.

The outputs of this process are modified values in the array CurrFrame.

The variables subX and subY describing the subsampling of the current plane
are derived as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX and subY are set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise (plane is not equal to 0), subX is set equal to subsampling_x
    and subY is set equal to subsampling_y.

    equal to 1.
    
  * Otherwise, if pass is equal to 1 and yP is an exact multiple of Tx_Height[ txSz ], isTxEdge is set
    equal to 1.

  * Otherwise, isTxEdge is set equal to 0.

derived as follows:

  * If isTxEdge is equal to 0, applyFilter is set equal to 0.

    to 1.

  * Otherwise applyFilter is set equal to 0.

The output of this process is the variable filterSize containing the maximum
filter size that can be used.

The purpose of this process is to reduce the width of the chroma filters and to ensure
that different boundaries can be filtered in parallel.

The variable baseSize is set equal to Min(prevTxSz, txSz).

The output variable filterSize is derived as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, filterSize is set equal to Min( TX_16X16, baseSize ),

  * Otherwise, (plane is greater than 0), filterSize is set
    equal to Min( TX_8X8, baseSize ).

#### Adaptive Filter Strength Process

  * the variables row and col specifying the luma location in units of 4x4 blocks,

  * the variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U or V samples,

  * the variable pass specifying the direction of the edge being filtered. pass equal to 0 means we are

       to 1.

    2. Otherwise (if mode is an intra type or GLOBALMV or GLOBAL_GLOBALMV), modeType is set equal
       to 0.

  * The variable deltaLF is derived as follows:
  
    1. If delta_lf_multi is equal to 0, deltaLF is set equal to DeltaLFs[ row ][ col ][ 0 ].

    2. Otherwise (delta_lf_multi is equal to 1), deltaLF is set equal to
       DeltaLFs[ row ][ col ][ ( plane == 0 ) ? pass : ( plane + 1 ) ].

  * The adaptive filter strength selection process specified in [section 7.10.4][] is invoked, with segment,
    ref, modeType, deltaLF, plane, and pass as inputs, and the output being the output variable
    lvl.

The variable shift is derived as follows:

  * If loop_filter_sharpness is greater than 4, shift is set equal to 2.

  * Otherwise, if loop_filter_sharpness is greater than 0, shift is set equal
    to 1.

  * Otherwise, shift is set equal to 0.

The output variable limit is derived as follows:

  * If loop_filter_sharpness is greater than 0, limit is set equal to
    Clip3( 1, 9 - loop_filter_sharpness, lvl \>\> shift ).

  * Otherwise, limit is set equal to Max( 1, lvl \>\> shift ).

The output variable blimit is set equal to 2 * (lvl + 2) + limit.

 * The variable ref, specifying the reference frame type (INTRA_FRAME, LAST_FRAME, etc.),
 
 * The variable modeType, specifying the loop filter mode type,

 * The variable deltaLF, specifying the loop filter delta value,

 * The variable plane, specifying whether we are filtering Y, U or V samples,

 * The variable pass, specifying the direction of the edge being filtered. pass equal to 0 means we are
   filtering vertical block boundaries, and pass equal to 1 means we are filtering horizontal block
   boundaries.

The output of this process is a filter strength level.

This process is invoked to select a loop filter strength level.

The variable i is set equal to ( plane == 0 ) ? pass : ( plane + 1 ).

The variable baseFilterLevel is set equal to Clip3( 0, MAX_LOOP_FILTER, deltaLF +
    loop_filter_level[ i ] ).

The following ordered steps apply:

  1. The variable nShift is set equal to baseFilterLevel \>\> 5.

  2. The variable lvlSeg is set equal to baseFilterLevel.

  3. The variable feature is set equal to SEG_LVL_ALT_LF_Y_V + i.

     ordered steps apply:

     a. lvlSeg is set equal to FeatureData[ segment ][ feature ] + lvlSeg.

     b. lvlSeg is set equal to Clip3( 0, MAX_LOOP_FILTER, lvlSeg ).

  5. If loop_filter_delta_enabled is equal to 1, then the following ordered steps apply:

        ( loop_filter_ref_deltas[ INTRA_FRAME ] \<\< nShift ).
        
     b. Otherwise, if ref is not equal to INTRA_FRAME, then lvlSeg is set equal to
        lvlSeg +
        ( loop_filter_ref_deltas[ ref ] \<\< nShift ) +
        ( loop_filter_mode_deltas[ modeType ] \<\< nShift ).

#### Sample Filtering Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * variables x and y specifying the location within CurrFrame[ plane ],

  * a variable plane specifying whether the block is the Y, U or V plane,

  * variables limit, blimit, thresh that specify the strength of the filtering
    operation,

  * variables dx and dy specifying the direction perpendicular to the edge
    being filtered,

  * a variable filterSize of specifying the maximum size of filter allowed.

The outputs of this process are modified values in the array CurrFrame.

First the filter mask process specified in [section 7.10.5.1][] is invoked with the
inputs x, y, plane, limit, blimit, thresh, dx, dy, and filterSize, and the
output is assigned to the variables hevMask, filterMask, flatMask, and
flatMask2.

Then the appropriate filter process is invoked with the inputs x, y, plane,
dx, dy as follows:

  * If filterMask is equal to 0, no filter is invoked.

  * Otherwise, if filterSize is equal to TX_4X4 or flatMask is equal to 0, the
    narrow filter process specified in [section 7.10.5.2][] is invoked with the
    additional input variable hevMask.

  * Otherwise, if filterSize is equal to TX_8X8 or flatMask2 is equal to 0,
    the wide filter process specified in [section 7.10.5.3][] is invoked with the
    additional input variable log2Size set to 3.

  * Otherwise, the wide filter process specified in [section 7.10.5.3][] is invoked
    with the additional input variable log2Size set to 4.


##### Filter Mask Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * variables x and y specifying the location within CurrFrame[ plane ],

  * a variable plane specifying whether the block is the Y, U or V plane,

  * variables limit, blimit, thresh that specify the strength of the filtering
    operation,

  * variables dx and dy specifying the direction perpendicular to the edge
    being filtered,

  * a variable filterSize of specifying the maximum size of filter allowed.

The outputs from this process are the variables:

  * hevMask,

  * filterMask,

  * flatMask, (only used if filterSize >= TX_8X8),

  * flatMask2 (only used if filterSize >= TX_16X16).

The values output for these masks depend on the differences between samples on
either side of the specified boundary. These samples are specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
q0 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ]
q1 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy     ][ x + dx     ]
q2 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy * 2 ][ x + dx * 2 ]
q3 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy * 3 ][ x + dx * 3 ]
q4 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy * 4 ][ x + dx * 4 ]
q5 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy * 5 ][ x + dx * 5 ]
q6 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy * 6 ][ x + dx * 6 ]
p0 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy     ][ x - dx     ]
p1 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 2 ][ x - dx * 2 ]
p2 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 3 ][ x - dx * 3 ]
p3 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 4 ][ x - dx * 4 ]
p4 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 5 ][ x - dx * 5 ]
p5 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 6 ][ x - dx * 6 ]
p6 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 7 ][ x - dx * 7 ]
~~~~~

**Note:** Samples q4, q5, q6, p4, p5, and p6 are only used if
filterSize is equal to TX_16X16.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The value of hevMask indicates whether the sample has high edge variance. It
is calculated as follows:

~~~~~ c
hevMask = 0
threshBd = thresh << (BitDepth - 8)
hevMask |= (Abs( p1 - p0 ) > threshBd)
hevMask |= (Abs( q1 - q0 ) > threshBd)
~~~~~

The value of filterMask indicates whether adjacent samples close to the
edge (within four samples either side of the specified boundary) vary by less
than the limits given by limit and blimit. It is used to determine if any
filtering should occur and is calculated as follows:

~~~~~ c
limitBd = limit << (BitDepth - 8)
blimitBd = blimit << (BitDepth - 8)
mask = 0
mask |= (Abs( p3 - p2 ) > limitBd)
mask |= (Abs( p2 - p1 ) > limitBd)
mask |= (Abs( p1 - p0 ) > limitBd)
mask |= (Abs( q1 - q0 ) > limitBd)
mask |= (Abs( q2 - q1 ) > limitBd)
mask |= (Abs( q3 - q2 ) > limitBd)
mask |= (Abs( p0 - q0 ) * 2 + Abs( p1 - q1 ) / 2 > blimitBd)
filterMask = (mask == 0)
~~~~~

The value of flatMask is only required when filterSize >= TX_8X8. It measures
whether samples from each side of the specified boundary are in
a flat region. That is whether those samples are at most (1 \<\< (BitDepth - 8))
different from the sample on the boundary. It is calculated as follows:

~~~~~ c
thresholdBd = 1 << (BitDepth - 8)
if ( filterSize >= TX_8X8 ) {
    mask = 0
    mask |= (Abs( p1 - p0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( q1 - q0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( p2 - p0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( q2 - q0 ) > thresholdBd)
    if ( plane == 0 ) {
        mask |= (Abs( p3 - p0 ) > thresholdBd)
        mask |= (Abs( q3 - q0 ) > thresholdBd)
    }
    flatMask = (mask == 0)
}
~~~~~

The value of flatMask2 is only required when filterSize >= TX_16X16. It
measures whether at least seven samples from each side of the specified
boundary are in a flat region assuming the first four on each side are
(so the full region is flat if flatMask & flatMask2 == 0). The value of
flatMask2 is calculated as follows:

~~~~~ c
thresholdBd = 1 << (BitDepth - 8)
if ( filterSize >= TX_16X16 ) {
    mask = 0
    mask |= (Abs( p6 - p0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( q6 - q0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( p5 - p0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( q5 - q0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( p4 - p0 ) > thresholdBd)
    mask |= (Abs( q4 - q0 ) > thresholdBd)
    flatMask2 = (mask == 0)
}
~~~~~

##### Narrow Filter Process

The inputs to this filter are:

  * a variable hevMask specifying whether this is a high edge variance case,

  * variables x, y specifying the the location within CurrFrame[ plane ],

  * a variable plane specifying whether the block is the Y, U or V plane,

  * variables limit, blimit, thresh that specify the strength of the filtering
    operation,

  * variables dx and dy specifying the direction perpendicular to the edge
    being filtered.

This process modifies up to two samples on each side of the specified boundary
depending on the value of hevMask as follows:

  * If hevMask is equal to 0 (i.e. the samples do not have high edge
    variance), this process modifies two samples on each side of the specified
    boundary, using a filter constructed from just the inner two (one from
    each side of the specified boundary).

  * Otherwise (the samples do have high edge variance), this process only
    modifies the one value on each side of the specified boundary, using a
    filter constructed from four input samples (two from each side of the
    specified boundary).

The process subtracts 0x80 \<\< (BitDepth - 8) from the input sample values so
that they are in the range -(1 \<\< (BitDepth - 1))
to (1 \<\< (BitDepth - 1)) - 1 inclusive. Intermediate values are made to be in
this range by the following function:

~~~~~ c
filter4_clamp( value ) {
    return Clip3( -(1 << (BitDepth - 1)), (1 << (BitDepth - 1)) - 1, value )
}
~~~~~

The process is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
q0 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ]
q1 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy ][ x + dx ]
p0 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy ][ x - dx ]
p1 = CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 2 ][ x - dx * 2 ]
ps1 = p1 - (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
ps0 = p0 - (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
qs0 = q0 - (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
qs1 = q1 - (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
filter = hevMask ? filter4_clamp( ps1 - qs1 ) : 0
filter = filter4_clamp( filter + 3 * (qs0 - ps0) )
filter1 = filter4_clamp( filter + 4 ) >> 3
filter2 = filter4_clamp( filter + 3 ) >> 3
oq0 = filter4_clamp( qs0 - filter1 ) + (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
op0 = filter4_clamp( ps0 + filter2 ) + (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
CurrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ] = oq0
CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy ][ x - dx ] = op0
if ( !hevMask ) {
    filter = Round2( filter1, 1 )
    oq1 = filter4_clamp( qs1 - filter ) + (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
    op1 = filter4_clamp( ps1 + filter ) + (0x80 << (BitDepth - 8))
    CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + dy ][ x + dx ] = oq1
    CurrFrame[ plane ][ y - dy * 2 ][ x - dx * 2 ] = op1
}
~~~~~

##### Wide Filter Process

The inputs to this filter are:

  * variables x, y specifying the the location within CurrFrame[ plane ],

  * a variable plane specifying whether the block is the Y, U or V plane,

  * variables dx and dy specifying the direction perpendicular to the edge
    being filtered,

  * a variable log2Size specifying the base 2 logarithm of the number of taps.

This filter is only applied when samples from each side of the boundary are
detected to be in a flat region.

The variable n (specifying the number of filter taps on each side of the
central sample) is set as follows:

  * If log2Size is equal to 4, n is set equal to 6.
  
  * Otherwise if plane is equal to 0, n is set equal to 3.
  
  * Otherwise (log2Size is equal to 3 and plane is greater than 0), n is set equal to 2.
  
The variable n2 (specifying the number of filter taps equal to 2 on each side of the central sample needed to give a unity DC gain) is set as follows:

  * If log2Size is equal to 3 and plane is equal to 0, n2 is set equal to 0.
  
  * Otherwise (log2Size is equal to 4 or plane is greater than 0), n2 is set equal to 1.

This process modifies the samples on each side of the specified boundary by
applying a low pass filter as follows:

~~~~~ c
for( i = -n; i < n; i++ ) {
    t = 0
    for( j = -n; j <= n; j++ ) {
        p = Clip3( -( n + 1 ), n, i + j )
        tap = ( Abs( j ) <= n2 ) ? 2 : 1
        t += CurrFrame[ plane ][ y + p * dy ][ x + p * dx ] * tap
    }
    F[ i ] = Round2( t, log2Size )
}
for( i = -n; i < n; i++ )
    CurrFrame[ plane ][ y+i * dy ][ x+i * dx ] = F[ i ]
~~~~~

where F is an array with indices from -n to n - 1 used to store the filtered
results.

### CDEF Process

Input to this process is the array CurrFrame of reconstructed samples.

Output from this process is the array CdefFrame containing deringed
samples.

The purpose of CDEF is to perform deringing based on the detected direction of blocks.

CDEF parameters are stored for each 64 by 64 block of pixels.

The CDEF filter is applied on each 8 by 8 block of pixels as follows:

~~~~~ c
step4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ BLOCK_8X8 ]
cdefSize4 = Num_4x4_Blocks_Wide[ BLOCK_64X64 ]
cdefMask4 = ~(cdefSize4 - 1)
for (r = 0; r < MiRows; r += step4) {
    for (c = 0; c < MiCols; c += step4) {
          baseR = r & cdefMask4
          baseC = c & cdefMask4
          idx = cdef_idx[ baseR ][ baseC ]
          cdef_block(r, c, idx)
    }
}
~~~~~

When the cdef_block function is called, the CDEF block process specified in [section 7.11.1][] is invoked with r, c, and idx as inputs.


#### CDEF Block Process

The inputs to this process are:

  *  variables r and c specifying the location of an 8x8 block in units
    of 4x4 blocks in the luma plane,
    
  * a variable idx specifying which set of CDEF parameters to use, or -1 to signal that no filtering should be applied.
    
The block is first copied to the CdefFrame as follows:

~~~~~ c
startY = r * MI_SIZE
endY = startY + MI_SIZE * 2
startX = c * MI_SIZE
endX = startX + MI_SIZE * 2
for( y = startY; y < endY; y++ ) {
    for( x = startX; x < endX; x++ ) {
        CdefFrame[ 0 ][ y ][ x ] = CurrFrame[ 0 ][ y ][ x ]
    }
}
startY >>= subsampling_y
endY >>= subsampling_y
startX >>= subsampling_x
endX >>= subsampling_x
for( y = startY; y < endY; y++ ) {
    for( x = startX; x < endX; x++ ) {
        CdefFrame[ 1 ][ y ][ x ] = CurrFrame[ 1 ][ y ][ x ]
        CdefFrame[ 2 ][ y ][ x ] = CurrFrame[ 2 ][ y ][ x ]
    }
}
~~~~~

**Note** If CDEF filtering turns out to be needed, then the contents of
CdefFrame will be overwritten later in this process.
{:.alert .alert-info }

If idx is equal to -1, then the process returns immediately after performing this copy.

The variable coeffShift is set equal to BitDepth - 8.

The variable skip is set equal to Skips[ r ][ c ].

The variable filterY (that says if the filter should be applied to the luma samples) is set equal to ( !skip ).

The variable filterUV (that says if the filter should be applied to the chroma samples) is set equal to ( !skip ).

If filterY is equal to 1 or filterUV is equal to 1, the CDEF direction process specified in [section 7.11.2][] is invoked with r and c as inputs, and the outputs assigned to variables yDir and var.

If filterY is equal to 1, the following ordered steps apply:

 1. The variable priStr is set equal to cdef_y_pri_strength[ idx ] \<\< coeffShift.
 
 2. The variable secStr is set equal to cdef_y_sec_strength[ idx ] \<\< coeffShift.
 
 3. The variable dir is set equal to ( priStr == 0 ) ? 0 : yDir.
 
 4. The variable varStr is set equal to ( var \>\> 6 ) ? Min( floor( log2( var \>\> 6 ) ), 12) : 0.
 
 5. The variable priStr is set equal to ( var ? ( priStr * ( 4 + varStr ) + 8 ) \>\> 4 : 0 ).
 
 6. The variable damping is set equal to CdefDamping + coeffShift.
 
 7. The CDEF filter process specified in [section 7.11.3][] is invoked with plane equal to 0, r, c, priStr, secStr, damping, and dir as input.
 
If filterUV is equal to 1, the following ordered steps apply:

 1. The variable priStr is set equal to cdef_uv_pri_strength[ idx ] \<\< coeffShift.
 
 2. The variable secStr is set equal to cdef_uv_sec_strength[ idx ] \<\< coeffShift.

#### CDEF Direction Process

The inputs to this process are variables r and c specifying the location of an 8x8 block in units of 4x4 blocks in the luma plane.

The outputs of this process are:

  * a variable yDir containing the direction of this block,
  
  * a variable var containing the variance for this block.
  
This block uses luma samples to measure the direction and variance of a block.

The process is specified as:

for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    cost[i] = 0
    for (j = 0; j < 15; j++)

        partial[2][i] += x
        partial[3][3 + i - j / 2] += x
        partial[4][7 + i - j] += x
        partial[5][3 - i / 2 + j] += x
        partial[6][j] += x
        partial[7][i / 2 + j] += x
    }

    }
}

#### CDEF Filter Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying which plane is being predicted,
  
  * variables r and c specifying the location of an 8x8 block in units of 4x4 blocks in the luma plane,

  * a variable priStr specifying the primary filter strength,
  
  * a variable secStr specifying the secondary filter strength,
  
  * a variable damping specifying a shift used for damping,
  
  * a variable dir specifying the detected direction of the block.

The process modifies samples in CdefFrame based on filtering samples from CurrFrame.

The extent of the space allowed for filtering is configured depending on loop_filter_across_tiles as follows:

  * If loop_filter_across_tiles is equal to 1, the following applies:
  
     - MiColStart is set equal to 0
     
     - MiRowStart is set equal to 0 
     
     - MiColEnd is set equal to MiCols
     
     - MiRowEnd is set equal to MiRows
     
     - AboveSameTileGroup is set equal to 1

  * Otherwise, MiColStart, MiRowStart, MiColEnd, MiRowEnd, AboveSameTileGroup are set equal to the values they had when the syntax element MiSizes[ r ][ c ] was written.

**Note:** These variables are used by the is_inside function to determine which
samples are available for use in filtering. If loop_filter_across_tiles is equal
to 1, the variables are set to indicate the whole frame is available. If
loop_filter_across_tiles is equal to 0, the variables are set according to the
tile that includes the current block.

The variable coeffShift is set equal to BitDepth - 8.

The filtering is applied as follows:

### Upscaling Process

Input to this process is an array inputFrame of width FrameWidth and height FrameHeight.

The variable UpscaledWidth is set equal to (FrameWidth * SUPERRES_NUM + (superres_denom / 2)) / superres_denom.

The output of this process is a horizontally upscaled frame of width UpscaledWidth and height FrameHeight.

If use_superres is equal to 0, no upscaling is required and this process returns inputFrame.

plane as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX is set equal to 0 and subY is set equal to 0.

### Loop Restoration Process

Input to this process are the arrays CurrFrame (of reconstructed samples) and CdefFrame (of deringed samples).

Output from this process is the array LrFrame of loop restored samples.

**Note:**
Although in this process we loop over 4x4 blocks,
loop restoration is designed to work in stripes 64 luma pixels high without needing additional line buffers.
Samples within the current stripe are fetched from CdefFrame. 
Samples outside the current stripe are fetched from CurrFrame (these samples will be deblocked, but will not have CDEF filtering applied).
{:.alert .alert-info }

The array LrFrame is set equal to a copy CdefFrame.  (The contents of LrFrame will later be overwritten for blocks that require restoration filtering.)

Next, loop restoration is applied for each 4x4 block of each plane as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( row = 0; row < MiRows; row++ ) {
    for ( col = 0; col < MiCols; col++ ) {
        for ( plane = 0; plane < 3; plane++ ) {
            loop_restore_block( plane, row, col)
        }
    }
}
~~~~~

When loop_restore_block is called, the loop restore block process in [section 7.13.1][] is invoked with plane, row, and col as inputs.

#### Loop Restore Block Process

The inputs to this block are:

  * a variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U, or V samples,

  * variables row and col specifying the location of the block in units
    of 4x4 blocks in the luma plane.
    
The output of this process are samples in LrFrame[ plane ].

The variables TileNum, MiColStart, MiRowStart, MiColEnd, MiRowEnd are set equal to the values they had when the syntax element MiSizes[ row ][ col ] was written.

The variable lumaY is set equal to row * MI_SIZE.

The variable stripeNum (specifying the zero-based index of the current stripe) is set equal to (lumaY + 8) / 64.

**Note:** The stripes are offset upwards by 8 luma pixels to make pipelined implementations more efficient.
When a row of superblocks has been received, enough rows of deblocked output can be produced to allow loop restoration of the corresponding stripes.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The variables subX and subY are set equal to the subsampling for the current
plane as follows:

  * If plane is equal to 0, subX is set equal to 0 and subY is set equal to 0.

  * Otherwise, subX is set equal to subsampling_x and subY is set equal to
   subsampling_y.
   
The variable StripeStartY (specifying the start of the stripe in units of samples in the current plane) is set equal to ( (-8 + stripeNum * 64) \>\> subY ).

The variable StripeEndY (specifying the end of the stripe in units of samples in the current plane) is set equal to StripeStartY + (64 \>\> subY) - 1.

**Note:** StripeStartY and StripeEndY are used by the get source sample process to decide whether to fetch from CurrFrame or CdefFrame.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The variable unitSize (specifying the size of restoration units in units of samples in the current plane) is set equal to LoopRestorationSize[ plane ].

The variable unitRows (specifying the number of restoration units down the tile) is set equal to count_units_in_tile( unitSize, (MiRowEnd - MiRowStart) * MI_SIZE \>\> subY ).

The variable unitCols (specifying the number of restoration units across the tile) is set equal to count_units_in_tile( unitSize, (MiColEnd - MiColStart) * MI_SIZE \>\> subX ).

**Note:** The number of restoration units in a tile can be different for chroma and luma.
{:.alert .alert-info }

The variable unitRow (specifying the vertical index of the current loop restoration unit) is set equal to Min( unitRows - 1, (row - MiRowStart) / unitSize).

The variable unitCol (specifying the horizontal index of the current loop restoration unit) is set equal to Min( unitCols - 1, (col - MiColStart) / unitSize).

The extent of the space allowed for filtering is configured depending on loop_filter_across_tiles as follows:

  * If loop_filter_across_tiles is equal to 1, the following applies:
  
     - TileStartX is set equal to 0
     
     - TileStartY is set equal to 0 
     
     - TileEndX is set equal to (MiCols * MI_SIZE \>\> subX) - 1
     
     - TileEndY is set equal to (MiRows * MI_SIZE \>\> subY) - 1
     
  * Otherwise (loop_filter_across_tiles is equal to 0), the following applies:
  
     - TileStartX is set equal to (MiColStart * MI_SIZE \>\> subX)
     
     - TileStartY is set equal to (MiRowStart * MI_SIZE \>\> subY) 
     
     - TileEndX is set equal to (MiColEnd * MI_SIZE \>\> subX) - 1
     
     - TileEndY is set equal to (MiRowEnd * MI_SIZE \>\> subY) - 1
     
The variable x is set equal to ( col * MI_SIZE \>\> subX ).

The variable y is set equal to ( row * MI_SIZE \>\> subY ).

The variable w is set equal to ( MI_SIZE \>\> subX ).

The variable h is set equal to ( MI_SIZE \>\> subY ).

(Variables x and y represent the position of the block in samples relative to the top-left corner of the current plane.
Variables w and h represent the size of the block in samples.)

**Note:** Although we describe the filter as operating on small blocks, the output will be the same
if larger blocks are used - provided all contained samples belong to the same loop restoration unit.
{:.alert .alert-info }
     
The variable rType (specifying the loop restoration type) is set equal to LrType[ TileNum ][ plane ][ unitRow ][ unitCol ].

The filter to used depends on rType as follows:

  * If rType is equal to RESTORE_WIENER, the Wiener filter process specified in [section 7.13.4][] is invoked with plane, unitRow, unitCol, x, y, w, and h as inputs.
  
  * Otherwise, if rType is equal to RESTORE_SGRPROJ, the self guided filter process specified in [section 7.13.2][] is invoked with plane, unitRow, unitCol, x, y, w, and h as inputs.
  
  * Otherwise (rType is equal to RESTORE_NONE), no filtering is applied.
  
#### Self Guided Filter Process

The inputs to this block are:

  * a variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U, or V samples,
  
  * variables unitRow and unitCol specifying the offset of the loop restoration unit with the current tile,
  
  * variables x and y specifying the position of the block in samples relative to the top-left corner of the current plane,

  * variables w and h specifying the size of the block in samples.

The arrays flt1 and flt2 are prepared by the following ordered steps:

  1. The variable set is set equal to LrSgrSet[ TileNum ][ plane ][ unitRow ][ unitCol ].
  
  2. The variable pass is set equal to 0.
  
  3. The box filter process specified in [section 7.13.3][] is invoked with plane, x, y, w, h, set, and pass as inputs, and the output assigned to flt1.
  
  4. The variable pass is set equal to 1.
  
  5. The box filter process specified in [section 7.13.3][] is invoked with plane, x, y, w, h, set, and pass as inputs, and the output assigned to flt2.
  
The restoration process is then applied for each sample as follows:

~~~~~ c
xqd0 = LrSgrXqd[ TileNum ][ plane ][ unitRow ][ unitCol ][ 0 ]
xqd1 = LrSgrXqd[ TileNum ][ plane ][ unitRow ][ unitCol ][ 1 ]
xq0 = xqd0
xq1 = (1 << SGRPROJ_PRJ_BITS) - xq0 - xqd1
for ( i = 0; i < h; i++ ) {
    for ( j = 0; j < w; j++ ) {
        u = CdefFrame[ plane ][ y + i ][ x + j ] << SGRPROJ_RST_BITS
        f1 = flt1[ i ][ j ] - u
        f2 = flt2[ i ][ j ] - u
        v = xq0 * f1 + xq1 * f2 + (u << SGRPROJ_PRJ_BITS)
        w = Round2( v, SGRPROJ_RST_BITS + SGRPROJ_PRJ_BITS )
        LrFrame[ plane ][ y + i ][ x + j ] = Clip1( w )
    }
}
~~~~~

#### Box Filter Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U, or V samples,
  
  * variables x and y specifying the position of the block in samples relative to the top-left corner of the current plane,

  * variables w and h specifying the size of the block in samples,
  
  * a variable set specifying the strength of the filtering,
  
  * a variable pass (equal to 0 or 1), specifying if we are generating the first or second filterred output.
  
The output of this process is a 2d array F.

The variable r (specifying that the box filters have side length 2*r+1) is set equal to Sgr_Params[ set ][ pass * 2 + 0 ].

The variable eps (specifying a scaling for the output) is set equal to Sgr_Params[ set ][ pass * 2 + 1 ].

The 2d arrays A and B (note these arrays are valid for coordinates including an extra sample around the boundary) are prepared as follows:

~~~~~ c
n = ( 2 * r + 1 ) * ( 2 * r + 1 )
n2e = n * n * eps
s = (((1 << SGRPROJ_MTABLE_BITS) + n2e / 2) / n2e)
for ( i = -1; i < h + 1; i++ ) {
    for ( j = -1; j < w + 1; j++ ) {
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for ( dy = -r ; dy <= r; dy++ ) {
            for ( dx = -r; dx <= r; dx++ ) {
                c = get_source_sample( plane, x + j + dx, y + i + dy )
                a += c * c
                b += c
            }
        }
        a = Round2( a, 2 * (BitDepth - 8) )
        b = Round2( b, BitDepth - 8 )
        p = Max( 0, a * n - b * b )
        z = Round2( p * s, SGRPROJ_MTABLE_BITS )
        if ( z >= 255 )
            a2 = 256
        else
            a2 = ((z << SGRPROJ_SGR_BITS) + (z/2)) / (z + 1)
        oneOverN = ((1 << SGRPROJ_RECIP_BITS) + (n/2)) / n
        b2 = ( (1 << SGRPROJ_SGR_BITS) - a2 ) * b * oneOverN
        A[ i ][ j ] = a2
        B[ i ][ j ] = Round2( b2, SGRPROJ_RECIP_BITS )
    }
}
~~~~~

where the call to get_source_sample specifies that the get source sample process specified in [section 7.13.6][] should be invoked
and the output assigned to variable c.

After A and B are prepared, the output array F is generated as follows:

~~~~~ c
for ( i = 0; i < h; i++ ) {
    for ( j = 0; j < w; j++ ) {
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for ( dy = -1 ; dy <= 1; dy++ ) {
            for ( dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++ ) {
                weight = (dx == 0 || dy == 0) ? 4 : 3
                a += weight * A[ i + dy ][ j + dx ]
                b += weight * B[ i + dy ][ j + dx ]
            }
        }
        v = a * CdefFrame[ plane ][ y + i ][ x + j ] + b
        F[ i ][ j ] = Round2( v, SGRPROJ_SGR_BITS + 5 - SGRPROJ_RST_BITS)
    }   
}
~~~~~

The constant lookup table Sgr_Params is specified as:

~~~~~ c
Sgr_Params[ (1 << SGRPROJ_PARAMS_BITS) ][ 4 ] = {
  { 2, 12, 1, 4 },  { 2, 15, 1, 6 },  { 2, 18, 1, 8 },  { 2, 20, 1, 9 },
  { 2, 22, 1, 10 }, { 2, 25, 1, 11 }, { 2, 35, 1, 12 }, { 2, 45, 1, 13 },
  { 2, 55, 1, 14 }, { 2, 65, 1, 15 }, { 2, 75, 1, 16 }, { 2, 30, 1, 6 },
  { 2, 50, 1, 12 }, { 2, 60, 1, 13 }, { 2, 70, 1, 14 }, { 2, 80, 1, 15 }
}
~~~~~

#### Wiener Filter Process

The inputs to this block are:

  * a variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U, or V samples,
  
  * variables unitRow and unitCol specifying the offset of the loop restoration unit with the current tile,
  
  * variables x and y specifying the position of the block in samples relative to the top-left corner of the current plane,

  * variables w and h specifying the size of the block in samples.
  
The output from this process are modified pixels in LrFrame.

The sub-sample interpolation is effected via two one-dimensional convolutions.
First a horizontal filter is used to build up a temporary array, and then this
array is vertically filtered to obtain the final prediction.

The Wiener coefficient process specified in [section 7.13.5][] is invoked with an input of LrWiener[ TileNum ][ plane ][ unitRow ][ unitCol ][ 0 ] and the output assigned to vfilter.

The Wiener coefficient process specified in [section 7.13.5][] is invoked with an input of LrWiener[ TileNum ][ plane ][ unitRow ][ unitCol ][ 1 ] and the output assigned to hfilter.

**Note:** The horizontal filter needs to be applied before the vertical filter, but the horizontal coefficients are sent after the vertical coefficients. 
{:.alert .alert-info }

The filtering is applied as follows:

  * The array intermediate is specified as follows:

    ~~~~~ c
    offset = (1 << (BitDepth + EXTRAPREC_BITS - 1))
    limit = (1 << (BitDepth + 1 + EXTRAPREC_BITS)) - 1
    for ( r = 0; r < h + 7; r++ ) {
        for ( c = 0; c < w; c++ ) {
            s = 0
            for ( t = 0; t < 7; t++ )
                s += hfilter[ t ] * get_source_sample( plane, x + c + t - 3, y + r - 3 )
            v = Round2(s, FILTER_BITS - EXTRAPREC_BITS)
            intermediate[ r ][ c ] = Clip3( -offset, limit - offset, v)
        }
    }
    ~~~~~
    
    Where the call to get_source_sample specifies that the get source sample process specified in [section 7.13.6][] should be invoked.
    
    **Note:** The intermediate result is clipped so that ( intermediate[ r ][ c ] + offset ) fits in an unsigned variable with (BitDepth + 3) bits.
    {:.alert .alert-info }
    
  * The output samples are written as follows:

    ~~~~~ c 
    for ( r = 0; r < h; r++ ) {
        for ( c = 0; c < w; c++ ) {
            s = 0
            for ( t = 0; t < 7; t++ )
                s += vfilter[ t ] * intermediate[ r + t ][ c ]
            v = Round2( s, FILTER_BITS + EXTRAPREC_BITS )
            LrFrame[ plane ][ y + r ][ x + c ] = Clip1( v )
        }
    }
    ~~~~~
    
#### Wiener Coefficient Process

The input to this process is an array coeff containing 3 coefficients.

The output from this process is an an array containing 7 coefficients.

The Wiener filter is always symmetrical and has a unit DC gain, so there are only three coefficients that need to be explicitly coded.

This process computes the full set of coefficients as follows:

~~~~~ c
filter[ 3 ] = 128
for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++ ) {
    c = coeff[ i ]
    filter[ i ] = c
    filter[ 6 - i ] = c
    filter[ 3 ] -= 2 * c
}
~~~~~

The output of the process is the array filter.

**Note:** When chroma is being filtered, coeff[ 0 ] will always be equal to 0, therefore filter[ 0 ] and filter[ 6 ] will always be equal to 0.
In other words, luma uses a 7-tap filter, while chroma uses a 5-tap filter.
{:.alert .alert-info }

#### Get Source Sample Process

The inputs to this process are:

  * a variable plane specifying whether we are filtering Y, U, or V samples,

  * variables x and y specifying the location in the current plane in units of samples.
  
This process makes sure samples are taken from within the allowed extent for loop restoration filtering.

Samples within the current stripe are taken after Cdef filtering has been applied, samples outside the current stripe
are taken before Cdef filtering.
  
The sample to return is specified as follows:

~~~~~ c
x = Min(TileEndX, x)
x = Max(TileStartX, x)
y = Min(TileEndY, y)
y = Max(TileStartY, y)
if (y < StripeStartY) {
    y = Max(StripeStartY - 2,y)
    return CurrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ]
} else if (y > StripeEndY) {
    y = Min(StripeEndY + 2,y)
    return CurrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ]
} else {
    return CdefFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ]
}
~~~~~

**Note:** This process can be called for samples on the three lines above and three lines below the current stripe.
However, the coordinates are cropped such that only two lines above and below the stripe need to be fetched.
In other words, requests for the third line (above or below) are given a copy of the second line.
{:.alert .alert-info }

### Output Process

This process is invoked to optionally display a frame.

If show_existing_frame is equal to 1, then the decoder should output a previously decoded frame as follows:

  * The variable w is set equal to RefFrameWidth[ frame_to_show_map_idx ].

  * The variable h is set equal to RefFrameHeight[ frame_to_show_map_idx ].

  * The variable subX is set equal to RefSubsamplingX[ frame_to_show_map_idx ].

  * The variable subY is set equal to RefSubsamplingY[ frame_to_show_map_idx ].

  * The Y plane is w samples across by h samples down and the sample at
    location x samples across and y samples down is given by
    FrameStore[ frame_to_show_map_idx ][ 0 ][ y ][ x ] with x = 0..w - 1
    and y = 0..h - 1.

  * The U plane is (w + subX) \>\> subX samples across by (h + subY) \>\> subY
    samples down and the sample at location x samples across and y samples
    down is given by FrameStore[ frame_to_show_map_idx ][ 1 ][ y ][ x ]
    with x = 0..((w + subX) \>\> subX) - 1 and y = 0..((h + subY) \>\> subY) - 1.

  * The V plane is (w + subX) \>\> subX samples across by (h + subY) \>\> subY
    samples down and the sample at location x samples across and y samples
    down is given by FrameStore[ frame_to_show_map_idx ][ 2 ][ x ][ y ]
    with x = 0..((w + subX) \>\> subX) - 1 and y = 0..((h + subY) \>\> subY) - 1.

  * The bit depth for each sample is RefBitDepth[ frame_to_show_map_idx ].
    
Otherwise, if show_frame is equal to 1, then the decoder should output the
    current frame as follows:

  * The variable w is set equal to FrameWidth.

  * The variable h is set equal to FrameHeight.

  * The variable subX is set equal to subsampling_x.

  * The variable subY is set equal to subsampling_y.

  * The Y plane is w samples across by h samples down and the sample at
    location x samples across and y samples down is given by
    CdefFrame[ 0 ][ y ][ x ] with x = 0..w - 1 and y = 0..h - 1.

  * The U plane is (w + subX) \>\> subX samples across by (h + subY) \>\> subY
    samples down and the sample at location x samples across and y samples
    down is given by CdefFrame[ 1 ][ y ][ x ]
    with x = 0..((w + subX) \>\> subX) - 1 and y = 0..((h + subY) \>\> subY) - 1.

  * The V plane is (w + subX) \>\> subX samples across by (h + subY) \>\> subY
    samples down and the sample at location x samples across and y samples
    down is given by CdefFrame[ 2 ][ x ][ y ]
    with x = 0..((w + subX) \>\> subX) - 1 and y = 0..((h + subY) \>\> subY) - 1.

  * The bit depth for each sample is BitDepth.


### Reference Frame Update Process

This process is invoked as the final step in decoding a frame.

The inputs to this process are the decoded samples for the current frame
LrFrame[ plane ][ x ][ y ].

The output from this process is an updated set of reference frames and
previous motion vectors.

For each value of i from 0 to NUM_REF_FRAMES - 1, the following applies
if bit i of refresh_frame_flags is equal to 1 (i.e.
if (refresh_frame_flags \>\> i) & 1 is equal to 1):

  * RefFrameWidth[ i ] is set equal to FrameWidth.

  * RefFrameHeight[ i ] is set equal to FrameHeight.

  * RefSubsamplingX[ i ] is set equal to subsampling_x.

  * RefSubsamplingY[ i ] is set equal to subsampling_y.

  * RefBitDepth[ i ] is set equal to BitDepth.

  * RefDecodeOrder[ i ] is set equal to DecodeOrder.

  * FrameStore[ i ][ 0 ][ y ][ x ] is set equal to LrFrame[ 0 ][ y ][ x ]
    for x = 0..FrameWidth-1, for y = 0..FrameHeight-1.

  * FrameStore[ i ][ plane ][ y ][ x ] is set equal to
    LrFrame[ plane ][ y ][ x ] for plane = 1..2,
    for x = 0..((FrameWidth + subsampling_x) \>\> subsampling_x) - 1,
    for y = 0..((FrameHeight + subsampling_y) \>\> subsampling_y) - 1.

  * SavedMvs[ i ][ row ][ col ][ list ][ comp ] is set equal to
    Mvs[ row ][ col ][ list ][ comp ] for row = 0..MiRows-1,
    for col = 0..MiCols-1, for list = 0..1, for comp = 0..1.
    
  * SavedGmParams[ i ][ ref ][ j ] is set equal to gm_params[ ref ][ j ]
    for ref = LAST_FRAME..ALTREF_FRAME,
    for j = 0..5.
    
  * SavedSegmentIds[ i ][ row ][ col ] is set equal to
    SegmentIds[ row ][ col ] for row = 0..MiRows-1,
    for col = 0..MiCols-1.
    
  * The function save_cdfs( i ) is invoked (see below).
    
save_cdfs( ctx ) is a function call that indicates that all the CDF arrays are saved into frame context number ctx in the range 0 to (NUM_REF_FRAMES - 1).
When this function is invoked the following takes place:

  * A copy of each CDF array mentioned in the semantics for setup_past_independence is saved in an area of memory indexed by ctx.

**Note:** Although this process stores all the motion vectors, only the values where row and col are both odd will be used again.
