### Chroma Format

The human visual system is said to be less sensitive to color than to luminance
so images are often coded with fewer chroma samples than luminance samples.

AV1 provides the option for the 2 chroma planes (called U and V) to be
subsampled in either the horizontal or vertical direction (or both, or neither).

In profiles 0 and 2, only 4:2:0 format is allowed, which means that chroma is
subsampled in both the horizontal and vertical direction. In profiles 1 and 3,
all other subsampling formats are allowed.
