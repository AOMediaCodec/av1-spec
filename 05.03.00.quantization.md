### Quantization and Lossy Compression

In the example above our almost flat image would transform into a large DC
coefficient and small values for the other coefficients (called AC
coefficients). Although this is already an improvement, we can compress better
by quantizing the coefficients. This means that we divide the coefficients by a
**quantization** factor before encoding them, and then in the decode process
multiply by the quantization factor.

For example, suppose that we used a quantization factor of 10. Instead of
sending the numbers 322 and 2, we would instead send 322/10=32 and 2/10=0
(where we have rounded down to keep the numbers as integers). In the decoding
process we would compute 32 * 10 = 320 and 0 * 10 = 0, followed by the
transform (320 + 0) / 2 = 160 and (320 - 0) / 2 = 160.

So this has resulted in the decode of two values (160 and 160) that are close,
but not exactly the same as our source image for the benefit of only needing to
transmit the numbers 32 and 0. As we no longer decode to an exact match of the
source data, this is known as **lossy compression**.

Lossy compression is used for most broadcast videos as it results in large
bandwidth savings, but for some applications (such as video editing) it is
useful to be able to use lossless compression. Lossless compression avoids the
growth of the small errors introduced by each repeated application of lossy
compression if the same video sequence were to be repeatedly decompressed and
recompressed.

AV1 supports both lossy and lossless coding. Lossless coding is indicated by
using the smallest quantization factor and this automatically switches to use a
perfectly invertible transform known as the Walsh-Hadamard transform.
