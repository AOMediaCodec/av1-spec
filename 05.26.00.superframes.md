### 5.26 Superframes

AV1 supports consolidating multiple compressed video frames into one single
chunk called a superframe. The superframe index is stored in the last bytes of
the chunk (and is up to 34 bytes long). The enclosed frames can be located by
parsing this superframe index:

From the point of view of the container format, this whole superframe is stored
together. This format can be useful to ensure that each superframe produces a
single decoded frame even though the video is coded using unshown frames.
However, it is also legal for a superframe to result in multiple output frames,
or even no output frames.
