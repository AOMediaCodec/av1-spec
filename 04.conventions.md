## Conventions

### General

The mathematical operators and their precedence rules used to describe this
Specification are similar to those used in the C programming language.
However, the operation of integer division with truncation is specifically
defined.

In addition, a length 2 array used to hold a motion vector (indicated
by the variable name ending with the letters `Mv` or `Mvs`) can be accessed
using either array notation (e.g. `Mv[ 0 ]` and `Mv[ 1 ]`), or by just
the name (e.g., `Mv`). The only operations defined when using the name are
assignment and equality/inequality testing. Assignment of an array is
represented using the notation `A = B` and is specified to mean the same
as doing both the individual assignments `A[ 0 ] = B[ 0 ]` and
`A[ 1 ] = B[ 1 ].` Equality testing of 2 motion vectors is represented using the
notation `A == B` and is specified to mean the same as
`(A[ 0 ] == B[ 0 ] && A[ 1 ] == B[ 1 ])`. Inequality testing is defined as
`A != B` and is specified to mean the same as
`(A[ 0 ] != B[ 0 ] || A[ 1 ] != B[ 1 ])`.

When a variable is said to be representable by a signed integer with `x` bits,
it means that the variable is greater than or equal to `-(1 << (x-1))`, and that
the variable is less than or equal to `(1 << (x-1))-1`.

The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
"should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and
"optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.


### Arithmetic operators

|:--------:| ------- |
| +        | Addition
| –        | Subtraction (as a binary operator) or negation (as a unary prefix operator)
| *        | Multiplication

| ceil(x)  | The smallest integer that is greater or equal than `x`.
| floor(x) | The largest integer that is smaller or equal than `x`.

Bits shifted into the MSBs as a result of the right shift have a value equal to the MSB of `a` prior to the shift operation.
| a&nbsp;\<\<&nbsp;b | Shift `a` in 2's complement binary integer representation format to the left by `b` bit positions. This operator is only used with `b` being a non-negative integer. Bits shifted into the LSBs as a result of the left shift have a value equal to `0`.

### Assignment

|:--------:| ------- |
| =        | Assignment operator

| +=       | Addition assignment operator, for example `x += 3` corresponds to `x = x + 3`
| -=       | Subtraction assignment operator, for example `x -= 3` corresponds to `x = x - 3`

The definition of Round2 uses standard mathematical power and division
operations, not integer operations. An equivalent definition using integer
operations is:

~~~~~ c
Round2( x, n ) {
  if ( n == 0 )
    return x
  return ( x + ( 1 << (n - 1) ) ) >> n
}
~~~~~

The FloorLog2(x) function is defined to be the floor of the base 2 logarithm of
the input x.

The input x will always be an integer, and will always be greater than or equal
to 1.

This function extracts the location of the most significant bit in x.

An equivalent definition (using the pseudo-code notation introduced in the
following section) is:

~~~~~ c
FloorLog2( x ) {
  s = 0
  while ( x != 0 ) {
    x = x >> 1
    s++
  }
  return s - 1
}
~~~~~

The CeilLog2(x) function is defined to be the ceiling of the base 2 logarithm of
the input x (when x is 0, it is defined to return 0).

The input x will always be an integer, and will always be greater than or equal
to 0.

This function extracts the number of bits needed to code a value in the
range 0 to x-1.

An equivalent definition (using the pseudo-code notation introduced in the
following section) is:

~~~~~ c
CeilLog2( x ) {
  if ( x < 2 )
    return 0
  i = 1
  p = 2
  while ( p < x ) {
    i++
    p = p << 1
  }
  return i
}
~~~~~

### Method of describing bitstream syntax

The description style of the syntax is similar to the C programming language.
Syntax elements in the bitstream are represented in bold type. Each syntax
element is described by its name (using only lower case letters with
underscore characters) and a descriptor for its method of coded
representation. The decoding process behaves according to the value of the
syntax element and to the values of previously decoded syntax elements. When a
value of a syntax element is used in the syntax tables or the text, it appears
in regular (i.e. not bold) type. If the value of a syntax element is being
computed (e.g. being written with a default value instead of being coded in
the bitstream), it also appears in regular type (e.g. tile_size_minus_1).

In some cases the syntax tables may use the values of other variables derived
from syntax elements values. Such variables appear in the syntax tables, or
text, named by a mixture of lower case and upper case letter and without any
underscore characters. Variables starting with an upper case letter are
derived for the decoding of the current syntax structure and all depending
syntax structures. These variables may be used in the decoding process for
later syntax structures. Variables starting with a lower case letter are only
used within the process from which they are derived. (Single character variables
are allowed.)

Constant values appear in all upper case letters with underscore characters
(e.g. MI_SIZE).

Constant lookup tables appear as words (with the first letter of each word in
upper case, and remaining letters in lower case) separated with underscore
characters (e.g. Block_Width[...]).

Hexadecimal notation, indicated by prefixing the hexadecimal number by `0x`,
may be used when the number of bits is an integer multiple of 4. For example,
`0x1a` represents a bit string `0001 1010`.

Binary notation is indicated by prefixing the binary number by `0b`. For
example, `0b00011010` represents a bit string `0001 1010`. Binary numbers may
include underscore characters to enhance readability. If present, the
underscore characters appear every 4 binary digits starting from the LSB. For
example, `0b11010` may also be written as `0b1_1010`.

A value equal to 0 represents a FALSE condition in a test statement. The
value TRUE is represented by any value not equal to 0.

The following table lists examples of the syntax specification format. When
`syntax_element` appears (with bold face font), it specifies that this syntax
element is parsed from the bitstream.

### Functions

Bitstream functions used for syntax description are specified in this section.

Other functions are included in the syntax tables. The convention is that a
section is called syntax if it causes syntax elements to be read from the
bitstream, either directly or indirectly through subprocesses. The remaining
sections are called functions.

The specification of these functions makes use of a bitstream position
indicator. This bitstream position indicator locates the position of the bit
that is going to be read next.

**get_position( ):** Return the value of the bitstream position indicator.

**init_symbol( sz ):** Initialize the arithmetic decode process for the Symbol
decoder with a size of sz bytes as specified in [section 8.2.2][].

**exit_symbol( ):** Exit the arithmetic decode process as described in
[section 8.2.4][] (this includes reading trailing bits).


### Descriptors

#### General

The following descriptors specify the parsing of syntax elements. Lower case
descriptors specify syntax elements that are represented by an integer
number of bits in the bitstream; upper case descriptors specify syntax elements
that are represented by arithmetic coding.


#### f(n)

Unsigned n-bit number appearing directly in the bitstream. The bits are read
from high to low order.  The parsing process specified in [section 8.1][] is
invoked and the syntax element is set equal to the return value.


#### uvlc()

Variable length unsigned number appearing directly in the bitstream.
The parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| uvlc() {                                                  | **Type**

#### le(n)

Unsigned little-endian n-byte number appearing directly in the bitstream.
The parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| le(n) {                                                   | **Type**

|     }
|     return t
| }
{:.syntax }

**Note:** This syntax element will only be present when the bitstream position
is byte aligned.
{:.alert .alert-info }


#### leb128()

Unsigned integer represented by a variable number of little-endian bytes.

**Note:** This syntax element will only be present when the bitstream position
is byte aligned.
{:.alert .alert-info }

In this encoding, the most significant bit of each byte is equal to 1 to signal
that more bytes should be read, or equal to 0 to signal the end of the encoding.

A variable Leb128Bytes is set equal to the number of bytes read during this
process.

The parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| leb128() {                                                | **Type**

{% comment %}

{% endcomment %}

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the value returned from the
leb128 parsing process is less than or equal to (1 \<\< 32) - 1.

**leb128_byte** contains 8 bits read from the bitstream.  The bottom 7 bits are
used to compute the variable value. The most significant bit is used to indicate
that there are more bytes to be read.

It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the most significant bit of
leb128_byte is equal to 0 if i is equal to 7. (This ensures that this syntax
descriptor never uses more than 8 bytes.)

**Note:** There are multiple ways of encoding the same value depending on how
many leading zero bits are encoded. There is no requirement that this syntax
descriptor uses the most compressed representation. This can be useful for
encoder implementations by allowing a fixed amount of space to be filled in
later when the value becomes known.

#### su(n)

Signed integer converted from an n bits unsigned integer in the bitstream.
(The unsigned integer corresponds to the bottom n bits of the signed integer.)
The parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| su(n) {                                                   | **Type**

| }
{:.syntax }


#### ns(n)

Unsigned encoded integer with maximum number of values n (i.e. output in range
0..n-1).

This descriptor is similar to f(CeilLog2(n)), but reduces wastage incurred
when encoding non-power of two value ranges by encoding 1 fewer bits for the
lower part of the value range. For example, when n is equal to 5, the encodings
are as follows (full binary encodings are also presented for comparison):

| Value | Full binary encoding | ns(n) encoding |

The abbreviation ns stands for non-symmetric. This encoding is non-symmetric
because the values are not all coded with the same number of bits.


#### L(n)

Unsigned arithmetic encoded n-bit number encoded as n flags (a "literal"). The
flags are read from high to low order.  The syntax element is set equal to the
return value of read_literal( n ) (see [section 8.2.5][] for a specification of
this process).


#### S()

An arithmetic encoded symbol coded from a small alphabet of at most 16 entries.

The symbol is decoded based on a context sensitive CDF (see [section 8.3][] for
the specification of this process).


#### NS(n)

Unsigned arithmetic encoded integer with maximum number of values n (i.e. output
in range 0..n-1).

This descriptor is the same as ns(n) except the underlying bits are coded
arithmetically.
