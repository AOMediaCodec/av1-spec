## Conventions

The mathematical operators and their precedence rules used to describe this
Specification are similar to those used in the C programming language.
However, the operation of integer division with truncation is specifically
defined.

In addition, an array with 2 elements used to hold a motion vector (indicated
by the variable name ending with the letters `Mv` or `Mvs`) can be accessed
using either normal array notation (e.g. `Mv[ 0 ]` and `Mv[ 1 ]`), or by just
the name (e.g., `Mv`). The only operations defined when using the name are
assignment and equality/inequality testing. Assignment of an array is
represented using the normal notation `A = B` and is specified to mean the same
as doing both the individual assignments `A[ 0 ] = B[ 0 ]` and
`A[ 1 ] = B[ 1 ].` Equality testing of 2 motion vectors is represented using the
notation `A == B` and is specified to mean the same as
`(A[ 0 ] == B[ 0 ] && A[ 1 ] == B[ 1 ])`. Inequality testing is defined as
`A != B` and is specified to mean the same as
`(A[ 0 ] != B[ 0 ] || A[ 1 ] != B[ 1 ])`.

When a variable is said to be representable by a signed integer with `x` bits,
it means that the variable is greater than or equal to `-(1<<(x-1))`, and that
the variable is less than or equal to `(1<<(x-1))-1`.

### Method of describing bitstream syntax

The description style of the syntax is similar to the C programming language.
Syntax elements in the bitstream are represented in bold type. Each syntax
element is described by its name (using only lower case letters with
underscore characters) and a descriptor for its method of coded
representation. The decoding process behaves according to the value of the
syntax element and to the values of previously decoded syntax elements. When a
value of a syntax element is used in the syntax tables or the text, it appears
in regular (i.e. not bold) type. If the value of a syntax element is being
computed (e.g. being written with a default value instead of being coded in
the bitstream), it also appears in regular type.

In some cases the syntax tables may use the values of other variables derived
from syntax elements values. Such variables appear in the syntax tables, or
text, named by a mixture of lower case and upper case letter and without any
underscore characters. Variables starting with an upper case letter are
derived for the decoding of the current syntax structure and all depending
syntax structures. These variables may be used in the decoding process for
later syntax structures. Variables starting with a lower case letter are only
used within the process from which they are derived.

Constant values appear in all upper case letters with underscore characters.

Constant lookup tables appear in all lower case letters with underscore
characters.

Hexadecimal notation, indicated by prefixing the hexadecimal number by `0x`,
may be used when the number of bits is an integer multiple of 4. For example,
`0x1a` represents a bit string `0001 1010`.

Binary notation is indicated by prefixing the binary number by `0b`. For
example, `0b00011010` represents a bit string `0001 1010`. Binary numbers may
include underscore characters to enhance readability. If present, the
underscore characters appear every 4 binary digits starting from the LSB. For
example, `0b11010` may also be written as `0b1_1010`.

A value equal to 0 represents a FALSE condition in a test statement. The
value TRUE is represented by any value not equal to 0.

The following table lists examples of the syntax specification format. When
`syntax_element` appears (with bold face font), it specifies that this syntax
element is parsed from the bitstream.

descriptor or can be an expression used to specify its

### Functions

Functions used for syntax description are specified in this section.

The specification of these functions makes use of a bitstream position
indicator. This bitstream position indicator locates the position of the bit
that is going to be read next.

**get_position( ):** Return the value of the bitstream position indicator.

**init_bool( sz ):** Initialize the arithmetic decode process for the boolean
decoder with a size of sz bytes as specified in [section 9.2.1][].

**exit_bool( ):** Exit the arithmetic decode process as described in [section 9.2.3][].


### Descriptors

The following descriptors specify the parsing of syntax elements. Lower case
descriptors specify syntax elements that are represented by a fixed integer
number of bits in the bitstream; upper case descriptors specify syntax elements
that are represented by arithmetic coding.


#### f(n)

Unsigned n-bit number appearing directly in the bitstream. The bits are read
from high to low order.  The parsing process specified in [section 9.1][] is
invoked and the syntax element is set equal to the return value.

#### le(n)

Unsigned little-endian n-byte number appearing directly in the bitstream.
The parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

<div class="syntax">
le(n) {
    t = 0
    for( i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        <b>byte</b>                                                          f(8)
        t += ( byte << ( i * 8 ) )
    }
    return t
}
</div>

**Note:** This syntax element will only be present when the bitstream position is byte aligned.

#### s(n)

Signed integer using n bits for the value and 1 bit for a sign flag.  The
parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

<div class="syntax">
s(n) {
    <b>value</b>                                                             f(n)
    <b>sign</b>                                                              f(1)
return sign ? -value : value
</div>


#### B(p)

A single arithmetic encoded bit with estimated probability p/256 of being 0.
The syntax element is set equal to the return value of read_bool( p ) (see
[section 9.2.2][]‎ for a specification of this process).


#### L(n)

Unsigned arithmetic encoded n-bit number encoded as n flags (a "literal"). The
flags are read from high to low order.  The syntax element is set equal to the
return value of read_literal( n ) (see [section 9.2.4][] for a specification of
this process).


#### T

An arithmetic tree encoded value from a small alphabet. Such values represent
the leaves of a small binary tree. The (non-leaf) nodes of the tree have
associated probabilities p and are represented by B(p).  A zero represents
choosing the left branch below the current node and a one represents choosing
the right branch. Each element of this type defined in this document has an
associated table of values defined in this document. Reference is made to those
tables when required. (See [section 9.3][] for the specification of this process).

Every value (leaf) whose tree depth is x is decoded using x B(p) values.

There are many ways that a given alphabet can be represented. The choice of tree
has little impact on data rate but does affect decoder performance.  The trees
used by AV1 are chosen to (on average) minimize the number of calls to read_bool
(the function used to extract B(p) from the bitstream).  This is equivalent to
shaping the tree so that values that are more probable have smaller tree depth
than do values that are less probable.

#### S

An arithmetic encoded symbol coded from a small alphabet of at most 16 entries.

The symbol is decoded based on a context sensitive CDF (see [section 9.4][] for the specification of this process).

#### U(n)

Unsigned arithmetic encoded number with maximum number of values n (i.e. output in range 0..n-1).

This descriptor is similar to L(ceil(log2(n))), but reduces wastage incurred when encoding non-power of two
value ranges by encoding 1 fewer bits for the lower part of the value range. For example, when
n is equal to 5, the encodings are as follows (full binary encodings are also presented for
comparison):

| Value | Full binary encoding | U(n) encoding |
|:-----:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
|     0 |                  000 |            00 |
|     1 |                  001 |            01 |
|     2 |                  010 |            10 |
|     3 |                  011 |           110 |
|     4 |                  100 |           111 |

The parsing process for this descriptor is specified below:

<div class="syntax">
U( n ) {
    w = floor(log2(n)) + 1
    m = (1 << w) - n
    @@v                                                                  L( w - 1 )
    if (v < m)
        return v
    @@extra_bit                                                          L( 1 )
    return (v << 1) - m + extra_bit
