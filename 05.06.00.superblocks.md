### Superblocks

In some parts of the image there may be a large region that can all be predicted
at the same time (e.g. a still background image), while in other parts there may
be some fine details that are changing (e.g. in a talking head) and a smaller
block size would be appropriate. AV1 provides the ability to vary the block size
to handle a range of prediction sizes.

The decoder decodes each image in units of 64 by 64 pixel **superblocks**. Each
superblock has a **partition** which specifies how it is to be encoded. It can
consist of:

  * A single 64 by 64 block
  * Two 64 by 32 blocks
  * Two 32 by 64 blocks
  * Four 32 by 32 blocks

The individual parts are decoded in raster order.

Each 32 by 32 block can also be partitioned in a similar way all the way down
until we reach an 8x8 block which has the choices:

  * A single 8 by 8 block
  * Two 8 by 4 subblocks
  * Two 4 by 8 subblocks
  * Four 4 by 4 subblocks

An example partitioning of a 64 by 64 superblock is shown below:

</figure>

The numbers give the decode order of the blocks, while the numbers in brackets
give the block sizes. The blocks without sizes are subblocks of 8x8 blocks.

The difference between a block and a subblock is that a single block header
(called **mode info**) is sent for all the subblocks within an 8x8 region,
while each block has its own block header. The subblocks can have different
intra modes, or motion vectors, but they share some other information such as
which reference frame to predict from.
