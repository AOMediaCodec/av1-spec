### Purpose of AV1

This specification defines the AV1 video compression format which is a
bandwidth-efficient way of storing and transmitting video sequences. Video data
is very high bandwidth (e.g. a video of width 1920 pixels, and height 1080
pixels may contain 30 frames every second. Each pixel needs around 12 bits
resulting in a bandwidth of 1920 * 1080 * 30 * 12 = 746 million bits per
second.) The goal of AV1 is to provide a way that this video can be stored in a
compressed form that uses orders of magnitude fewer bits.

This specification describes the decoding process that takes a sequence of
compressed frames and turns it into a sequence of decompressed video frames
that can be displayed. All AV1 compliant decoders must decode compressed
frames in exactly the same way.

Note that the encoding process is not described here. There are many ways of
choosing how to encode the frames. Different ways can be better or worse
depending on how much they change the source image in ways that matter to the
human visual system and how many bits they end up using.
