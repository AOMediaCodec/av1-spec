### 5.9 Inverse ADST structure

The ADST is an alternative 1D transform which may be used to transform arrays
of length 4, 8, or 16.

In some stages, the ADST uses an array S of higher precision intermediate
results.  The butterfly operation SB stores its output in S, and the butterfly
operation SH takes its input from S.

The structure of the 8 point inverse ADST used for AV1 is shown in the diagram
below.

The structure of the 16 point inverse ADST is shown in the diagram below.

The 4 point ADST is treated as a special case and is implemented as eight
multiplications followed by a number of addition/subtraction/shift operations.
