### 5.16 Reference frame scaling

It is legal for different decoded frames to have different frame sizes (and
aspect ratios). AV1 automatically handles resizing predictions from reference
frames of different sizes.

However, reference frames must share the same color depth and subsampling
format for reference frame scaling to be allowed, and the amount of up/down
scaling is limited to be no more than 16x larger and no less than 2x smaller
(e.g. the new frame must not be more than 16 times wider or higher than any of
its used reference frames).
