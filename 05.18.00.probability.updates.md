### Probability Updates

The boolean decoder produces fewest bits when the estimated probabilities for the different syntax elements match the actual frequency with which the different cases occur.

AV1 provides two mechanisms to match these up:

  1. The probabilities can be explicitly changed in the frame headers. (In
     fact the probability changes are themselves coded using an arithmetic
     coder to reduce the cost of this process.)

  2. The boolean decoder keeps track of how many times each type of syntax
     element is decoded and can be told to automatically adjust the
     probabilities at the end of the frame to match the observed frequencies.

The idea with the first method is that we can reduce the number of bits to code the frame by setting the probabilities accurately â€“ but the cost is that we need to spend bits to perform the updates.

The idea with the second method is that the probabilities for the next frame are probably quite similar to the ones for this frame, so adapting the probabilities at the end of the frame can help to improve compression.
