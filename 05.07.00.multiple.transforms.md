### 5.7 Multiple transforms

AV1 specifies a number of different transforms that can be applied to the
residual. These differ in size (4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 are supported) and in
the type of transform. The type of transform can be varied independently for
rows and columns as being either an integer precision version of a
**Discrete Cosine Transform** or an **Asymmetric Discrete Sine Transform.**
The choice of transform type is deduced from the intra mode, while the choice
of transform size can either be specified at a frame level, or given on a
per-block basis.

The idea is that when we are doing intra prediction, normally the samples near
the known edges are predicted better than the ones further away so the errors
are usually small at one side. The Asymmetric Discrete Sine Transform does a
better job of transforming this shape because it has basis vectors that tend to
vanish at the known boundary, and maximize energy at the unknown boundary.

When the transform size is smaller than the block size, the transform blocks
are predicted and reconstructed in raster order. For example, suppose we had a
 64x64 intra block using a 16x16 transform size. The blocks would be processed
 in this order:

  1. Each of these 16 blocks would in turn have the following apply:

  2. The 16x16 block is predicted from previously decoded pixels.

  3. The 16x16 block of transform coefficients is inverse transformed to
     compute the residual.

The prediction is added to the residual to compute the decoded pixels.

Note that the prediction for the second 16x16 block can depend on the decoded
pixels from the first. (However, also note that the loop filtering is only
applied once the complete frame is decoded.)
