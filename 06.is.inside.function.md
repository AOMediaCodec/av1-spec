#### Is Inside Function

is_inside determines whether a candidate position is accessible for motion
vector prediction. Moving across the top tile edge is allowed when
dependent_tiles is equal to 1 and
the tile above is in the same tile group, but
moving across the other tile edges is always prohibited.

In addition, if the dependency would result in having to decode too large an area,
the AllowDependentTileRow array is used to break the horizontal dependency.

is_inside( candidateR, candidateC ) {
    if (candidateC >= MiColStart &&
        candidateC < MiColEnd &&
        candidateR < MiRowEnd) {
        if (candidateR >= MiRowStart)
            return 1
        if (dependent_tiles && AboveSameTileGroup) {
            return 1
        }
    }
    return 0
