### Inter Prediction

Suppose we are now trying to compress a whole video sequence.

Consider what we can predict about the next image from the previous one: there
may be some still parts of the image in the background, so some blocks may be
identical to their contents in the previous frame. Similarly, if the camera is
panning or some object is moving, there may be blocks that are very similar to
a slightly shifted part of the previous frame.

AV1 takes advantage of these cases by using **inter blocks**. An inter block
contains a motion vector that specifies the offset in the previous frame of the
part of the image to use as a prediction for this block. So, for example, still
blocks will be represented by a zero motion vector. The motion vector contains
information about both a vertical and horizontal offset to allow for both types
of movement.

As for intra blocks, the decoding process works by first computing the
prediction, and then inverse transforming the transform coefficients and adding
the result (the residual) to this prediction.

The motion vectors can specify shifts in units of whole pixels, or shifts
containing a fractional pixel offset. When a fractional pixel shift is used,
the previous frame is filtered in order to give a more accurate prediction.

It is also possible to choose the type of **interpolation filter** used in this
filtering. The main difference is in the filter bandwidth. If the source frames
are noisy, it can be appropriate to use a narrow bandwidth filter to discard
the noise, while if the source frames are clean we can use a higher bandwidth
filter to try and preserve more of the high frequency texture. This choice can
either be made for all blocks in a frame, or specified per block.
