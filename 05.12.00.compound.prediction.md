### 5.12 Compound prediction

As mentioned above, an inter block can be predicted using either a single
reference frame or a combination of two reference frames. The latter is called
**compound prediction** in which 2 motion vectors and 2 reference frames are
specified for an inter block.

In this case the prediction is first formed from each reference frame, and then
the final prediction is produced as an averaged combination of these two. The
hope is that the average is an even better predictor than either of the
originals.

The choice of compound prediction can either be made at the frame level, or
specified in the mode info for inter blocks.
