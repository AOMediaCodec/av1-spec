### 5.22 Zigzag ordering

The transform coefficients of natural blocks tend to be clustered around the
low frequency end. This means that there are often only a few non-zero
coefficients in a block and these are clustered in one corner of the
transformed block.

AV1 decodes the coefficients in a special zig-zag order such that the first
coefficient read is the DC coefficient, and then the order gradually moves
outward to higher frequency coefficients.

A bool is decoded after each non-zero coefficient that signals whether there
are any more non-zero coefficients in the whole transform block. When this
condition is detected, the decoder can immediately fill in the whole rest of
the transform block with zeros without consuming any more bits from the
bitstream.

Depending on the direction of intra prediction, the transform coefficients are
often clustered towards the left or the top side of the transform block.
Therefore AV1 selects the scan order based on the intra prediction direction.

An example scan ordering for a 4x4 block is illustrated in the diagram below,
where the numbers and arrows indicate the order of the decode process.
