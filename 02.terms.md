  intra prediction or inter prediction.

Mode info

: Syntax elements sent for a block containing an indication of how a block is
  to be predicted during the decoding process.

Mode info block

: A luma sample value block of size 4x4 or larger and its two corresponding
  chroma sample value blocks (if present).

Motion vector

: A two-dimensional vector used for inter prediction which refers the current
  frame to the reference frame, the value of which provides the coordinate
  offsets from a location in the current frame to a location in the reference
  frame.

OBU

: All structures are packetized in "Open Bitstream Units" or OBUs. Each OBU has
  a header, which provides identifying information for the contained data
  (payload).

Parse

: The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.

Prediction

: The implementation of the prediction process consisting of either inter or
  intra prediction.

Prediction process

: The process of estimating the decoded sample value or data element using a
  predictor.

Prediction value

: The value, which is the combination of the previously decoded sample values or
  data elements, used in the decoding process of the next sample value or data
  element.

Profile

: A subset of syntax, semantics and algorithms defined in a part.

Quantization parameter

: A variable used for scaling the quantized coefficients in the decoding
  process.

Quantized coefficient

: A transform coefficient before dequantization.

Raster scan

: Maps a two dimensional rectangular raster into a one dimensional raster, in
  which the entry of the one dimensional raster starts from the first row of the
  two dimensional raster, and the scanning then goes through the second row and
  the third row, and so on. Each raster row is scanned in left to right order.

Reconstruction

: Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding
  prediction values.
  
Reference

: One of a set of tags, each of which is mapped to a reference frame.

Reference frame

: A storage area for a previously decoded frame and associated information.

Reserved

: A special syntax element value which may be used to extend this part in the
  future.

Residual

: The differences between the reconstructed samples and the corresponding
  prediction values.

Sample

: The basic elements that compose the frame.

Sample value

: The value of a sample. This is an integer from 0 to 255 (inclusive) for 8-bit
  frames, from 0 to 1023 (inclusive) for 10-bit frames, and from 0 to 4095
  (inclusive) for 12-bit frames.

Segmentation map

: One 3-bit number per 4x4 block in the frame specifying the segment affiliation of that block.
  A segmentation map is stored for each reference frame to allow new frames to use a previously coded map.

Sequence

: The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or
  several consecutive coded frames.

Superblock

: The top level of the block quadtree within a tile. All superblocks within a
  frame are the same size and are square. The superblocks may be 128x128 luma samples
  or 64x64 luma samples. A superblock may contain 1 or 2 or 4 mode info blocks, or may be
  bisected in each direction to create 4 sub-blocks, which may themselves be
  further subpartitioned, forming the block quadtree.

Switch Frame

: An inter frame that can be used as a point to switch between sequences. Switch
  frames overwrite all the reference frames without forcing the use of intra
  coding.  The intention is to allow a streaming use case where videos can be
  encoded in small chunks (say of 1 second duration), each starting with a
  switch frame.  If the available bandwidth drops, the server can start sending
  chunks from a lower bitrate encoding instead. When this happens
  the inter prediction uses the existing higher quality reference frames
  to decode the switch frame.  This approach allows a bitrate switch without
  the cost of a full key frame.

Syntax element

: An element of data represented in the bitstream.

Temporal delimiter OBU

: An indication that the following OBUs will have a different
  presentation/decoding time stamp from the one of the last frame prior to the
  temporal delimiter.

Temporal unit

: A Temporal unit consists of all the OBUs that are associated with a specific,
  distinct time instant. It consists of a temporal delimiter OBU, and all the
  OBUs that follow, up to but not including the next temporal delimiter.

Temporal group

: A set of frames whose temporal prediction structure is used periodically in a
  video sequence.

Tier

: A specified category of level constraints imposed on the values of the syntax elements
  in the bitstream.

Tile

: A rectangular region of the frame that can be decoded
  and encoded independently, although loop-filtering across tile edges is still
  applied.

Transform block

: A rectangular transform coefficient matrix, used as input to the inverse transform
  process.

Transform coefficient

: A scalar value, considered to be in a frequency domain, contained in a
  transform block.

Uncompressed header

: High level description of the frame to be decoded that is encoded without the
  use of arithmetic encoding.
