## Terms and Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

AC coefficient

: Any transform coefficient whose frequency indices are non-zero in at least
  one dimension.

Altref

: (Alternative reference frame) A frame that can be used in inter coding.

Bitstream

: The sequence of bits generated by encoding a sequence of frames.

Bit string

: An ordered string with limited number of bits. The left most bit is the most
  significant bit (MSB), the right most bit is the least significant bit (LSB).

Block

: A square or rectangular region of pixels consisting of one Luma and two Chroma
  matrices.

Block scan

: A specified serial ordering of quantized coefficients.

Byte

: An 8-bit bit string.

Byte alignment

: One bit is byte aligned if the position of the bit is an integer multiple of
  eight from the position of the first bit in the bitstream.

CDEF

: Constrained Directional Enhancement Filter designed to adaptively filter blocks based on identifying the direction.
  
CDF

: Cumulative distribution function representing the probability times 32768 that
  a symbol has value less than or equal to a given level.

Chroma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value of one of the two color
  difference signals.

  **Note:** Symbols of chroma are U and V.
  {:.alert .alert-info }


Coded frame

: The representation of one frame before the decoding process.

Component

: One of the three sample value matrices (one luma matrix and two chroma
  matrices) or its single sample value.

Compound prediction

: A type of inter prediction where sample values are computed by blending
  together predictions from two reference frames (the frames blended can be the same or different).

DC coefficient

: A transform coefficient whose frequency indices are zero in both dimensions.

Decoded frame

: The frame reconstructed out of the bitstream by the decoder.

Decoder

: One embodiment of the decoding process.

Decoding process

: The process that derives decoded frames from syntax elements.

Dequantization

: The process in which transform coefficients are obtained by scaling the
  quantized coefficients.

Encoder

: One embodiment of the encoding process.

Encoding process

: A process not specified in this Specification that generates the bitstream
  that conforms to the description provided in this document.

Flag

: A binary variable - some variables and syntax elements (e.g. obu_extension_flag)
  are described using the word flag to highlight
  that the syntax element can only be equal to 0 or equal to 1.

Frame

: The representation of video signals in the spatial domain, composed of one luma
  sample matrix (Y) and two chroma sample matrices (U and V).

Frame context

: A set of probabilities used in the decoding process.

Frame buffer

: A storage area for a previously decoded frame and associated information.

Golden frame

: A frame that can be used in inter coding. Typically the golden frame is
  encoded with higher quality and is used as a reference for multiple inter frames.

Inter coding

: Coding one block or frame using inter prediction.

Inter frame

: A frame compressed by referencing previously decoded frames and which may use
  intra prediction or inter prediction.

Inter prediction

: The process of deriving the prediction value for the current frame using
  previously decoded frames.

Intra coding

: Coding one block or frame using intra prediction.

Intra frame

: A frame compressed using only intra prediction which can be independently
  decoded.

Intra-only frame

: A type of intra frame that does not reset the decoding process. 

  **Note:** A key frame is different to an intra-only frame even though both
  only use intra prediction. The difference is that a key frame fully resets the
  decoding process.  For example, for a sequence of frames A, B, C, frame C can
  use frame A as a reference if B was an intra-only frame - but not if B was
  a keyframe.

Intra prediction

: The process of deriving the prediction value for the current sample using
  previously decoded sample values in the same decoded frame.

Inverse transform

: The process in which a transform coefficient matrix is transformed into a
  spatial sample value matrix.

Key frame

: A frame where the decoding process is reset. Key frames, and following frames,
  are always decodable without access to preceding frames. A key frame only uses
  intra prediction.

Level

: A defined set of constraints on the values for the syntax elements and
  variables.

Loop filter

: A filtering process applied to the reconstruction intended to reduce the
  visibility of block edges.

Luma

: A sample value matrix or a single sample value representing the monochrome
  signal related to the primary colors.

  **Note:** The symbol representing luma is Y.
  {:.alert .alert-info }

Mode info

: Syntax elements sent for a block containing an indication of how a block is
  to be predicted during the decoding process.

Mode info block

: A luma sample value block of size 4x4 or larger and its two corresponding
  chroma sample value blocks (if present).

Motion vector

: A two-dimensional vector used for inter prediction which refers the current
  frame to the reference frame, the value of which provides the coordinate
  offsets from a location in the current frame to a location in the reference
  frame.
  
OBU

: All structures are packetized in "Open Bitstream Units" or OBUs.  
  Each OBU has a header, which provides identifying information for the contained data (payload).

Parse

: The procedure of getting the syntax element from the bitstream.

Prediction

: The implementation of the prediction process consisting of either inter or
  intra prediction.

Prediction process

: The process of estimating the decoded sample value or data element using a
  predictor.

Prediction value

: The value, which is the combination of the previously decoded sample values or
  data elements, used in the decoding process of the next sample value or data
  element.

Profile

: A subset of syntax, semantics and algorithms defined in a part.

Quantization parameter

: A variable used for scaling the quantized coefficients in the decoding
  process.

Quantized coefficient

: A transform coefficient before dequantization.

Raster scan

: Maps a two dimensional rectangular raster into a one dimensional raster, in
  which the entry of the one dimensional raster starts from the first row of the
  two dimensional raster, and the scanning then goes through the second row and
  the third row, and so on. Each raster row is scanned in left to right order.

Reconstruction

: Obtaining the addition of the decoded residual and the corresponding
  prediction values.

Reference frame

: A previously decoded frame used during inter prediction.

Reserved

: A special syntax element value which may be used to extend this part in the
  future.

Residual

: The differences between the reconstructed samples and the corresponding
  prediction values.

Sample

: The basic elements that compose the frame.

Sample value

: The value of a sample. This is an integer from 0 to 255 (inclusive) for 8-bit
  frames, from 0 to 1023 (inclusive) for 10-bit frames, and from 0 to 4095
  (inclusive) for 12-bit frames.

Segmentation map

: A 3-bit number containing the segment affiliation for each 4x4 block in the
  image. The segmentation map persists across frames.  (TODO change with segment_pred_last experiment)

Sequence

: The highest level syntax structure of coding bitstream, including one or
  several consecutive coded frames.

Superblock

: The top level of the block quadtree within a tile. All superblocks within a frame are the same size and are square. The
  superblocks may be 128x128 pixels or 64x64 pixels. A superblock may contain 1 or 2 mode info blocks, or
  may be bisected in each direction to create 4 sub-blocks, which may themselves be further subpartitioned,
  forming the block quadtree.
  
Switch Frame

: An inter frame that can be used as a point to switch scalability layers.  Switch frames overwrite all the frame buffers without forcing the use of intra coding.

Syntax element

: An element of data represented in the bitstream.

Temporal delimiter OBU

: An indication that the following OBUs will have a different presentation/decoding time stamp from the one of the last frame prior to the temporal delimiter.

Temporal unit

: A Temporal unit consists of all the OBUs that are associated with a specific, distinct time instant.
  It consists of a temporal delimiter OBU, and all the OBUs that follow, up to but not including the next temporal delimiter.

Tile

: A rectangular region of the frame that is intended to be able to be decoded
  and encoded independently, although loop-filtering across tile edges may still
  be applied. 

  **Note:** For AV1 this intention is only partially met. Partitioning into
  columns works as expected, but partitioning into rows does not. The decode of
  a tile depends on the decode of the tile above if dependent_tiles is equal to 1.

Transform block

: A square transform coefficient matrix, used as input to the inverse transform
  process.

Transform coefficient

: A scalar value, considered to be in a frequency domain, contained in a
  transform block.

Uncompressed header

: High level description of the frame to be decoded that is encoded without the
  use of arithmetic encoding.
