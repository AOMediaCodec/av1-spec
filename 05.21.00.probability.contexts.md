### 5.21 Probability contexts

When coding a syntax element, such as whether the block is skipped, AV1 defines
a process to determine which probability to use. The choice of probability is
based on the context of the syntax element, e.g. on how that syntax element has
been decoded in the past for blocks that are similar in some way â€“ such as
being close or being of the same size.

This process makes it more likely that the decoder can accurately predict the
probability distribution of a syntax element and therefore can represent the
syntax element using fewer bits on average.
